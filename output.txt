A bee to fields, of tribute well,
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
A book at mornings here read...
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
A bowl
A brave sledge-cart from fieldâ€™s returning, Itâ€™s fluffy furrows upturning,
A dwarf with tail; and thereâ€™s that Whoâ€™s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
A hundred times is blessed, whoâ€™s faithful. Whoâ€™s got his wit to be quite calm,
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
A ladyâ€™s love until to-day To speak her Russian isnâ€™t trying,
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
A menu hangs for orderâ€™s sake And teases appetite in vain.
A mere hit from all Iâ€™d give.
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
A need for sleep.
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
A passionate epistleâ€™s writing.
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
A shepherd bast gay sandalâ€™s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
A simple maiden
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
A yard boyâ€™s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: â€˜Well, heâ€™s killed...â€™
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relationâ€™s lint, -
About Lenskyâ€™s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didnâ€™t talk at all,
About otherâ€™s restless passions, And otherâ€™s love will touch the heart, -
About what sheâ€™s now dreaming?
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
Across a glade, all under snow Around which allâ€™s dark and sad.
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
Again promiscuosly heâ€™s readingâ€¦ Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
˜Agreedâ€™ - You... dear guy!
Ah! Iâ€™ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
Ah, donâ€™t mindâ€™ -My friend, by God to hail I dare â€”
˜Ah, Eugene!â€™, - She is quickly running, Like shade sheâ€™s prompt, to exitâ€™s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back itâ€™s hard; In short a minute sheâ€™s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
˜Ah, father my! the profitâ€™s worsened..â€™.
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
Ah, he could love; they donâ€™t now Have anything like real love
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyanaâ€™s heart was burnt!
Ah, many friends were near then!
Ah, many were by fate denied!
˜Ah, my Lord!â€™,
˜Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, Iâ€™m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Oneginâ€™ -Well done dealing.
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
˜Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
˜Ah, Tanya!
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
˜Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?â€™ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, Iâ€™ve ruined much of own life.
Alas! I must repeat again:
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
Alas! On furrows of lives
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldnâ€™t be.
Alas, itâ€™s easy to divine!
Alas, Tatyanaâ€™s daily fading: Sheâ€™s paling, sinking and is mute,
Ali that has gone like soundâ€™s fizz, And dear Tanyaâ€™s youth all dwindles:
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
All barking, dogs to her are running.
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
All fashioned model of the creature Whoâ€™s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
All flows in a single gear...
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
All have the supper.
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
All poets, meanwhile Iâ€™ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: â€˜Itâ€™s mine! Its mineâ€™
All right, by hand unfair own
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
All services of old time.
All that I donâ€™t grasp.
All that I gladlessly survived.
- All they are yet feeling
All they utter
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end lifeâ€™s novel reading,
All yet living
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
Allâ€™s blight, allâ€™s white without shade.
Allâ€™s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I donâ€™t know why.
Allâ€™s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Allâ€™s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
Allâ€™s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy PustyakÃ³v
Alone to my nurse, whoâ€™s being My old friend from youth and forth.
Alone with his soulâ€™s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
Alone you, to speak my mind, Iâ€™d take as friend of days my grievous,
Aloneâ€™s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girlâ€™s small feet and no heads.
Already for triumph heâ€™s waiting,
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
Alter him
Among admirers obedient Iâ€™ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
Among the friends the moonâ€™s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poetâ€™s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journalâ€™s clamour
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
An Laneâ€™s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maidenâ€™s choice,
And all grandparents exclaim: â€™But how years fly away!â€™
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soulâ€™s rate
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!â€™
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
And am I soon at thirties turn?
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
And boring picturesâ€™ row, done In style of La Fontaineâ€™s sweet novels.
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
And by degrees to sleep heâ€™s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
And by the peopleâ€™s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
And canâ€™t; sheâ€™s now deeply worrier!, She moans and sheâ€™d like to cry...
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
And didnâ€™t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
And drifting of the countryâ€™s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
And even this my chapter five â€” From all digressions to refine.
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
And exclamations at the board:
And fair sex like downâ€™s slight...
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
And give you all that 1 could scribble
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
And gradually rises day.
And great belief in worldâ€™s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
˜And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
And he inspired her at dawns!
And he invents by whimâ€™s requests Caricatures of the guests.
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; thatâ€™s why at borne
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
And here is the banns room.
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
And how long?â€™ â€˜Two will he fast...â€™
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
˜And I was gingebread you giving!â€™
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
˜And I your ears pulled by hands!â€™
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
And in a day
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
And in the solitude severe Her passionâ€™s heating yet much more,
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
And is it true, it canâ€™t return?
And Iâ€™ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
And Iâ€™m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
And Iâ€™m in family unknown...
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful sheâ€™s shyly stepping
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
And let them God long live for us!
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
And me you have in view...
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
And much the more itâ€™s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
And no brow moved she rasher; She didnâ€™t even lips her press.
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
And now jealouserâ€™s triumphant!
And now North, all clouds driving,
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
And often at Tauridaâ€™s beaches She brought me in the have of night
And often in the summerâ€™s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
And old barin room this had;
And Olgaâ€™s yawning; round here Sheâ€™s looking for her Lensky dear.
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
And passed away of tears time?
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l donâ€™t want;
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
And proud languageâ€™s now lit For prose postal a bit.
And quickly both they yet off
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldnâ€™t cry,
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once oneâ€™s feelings strikes.
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again heâ€™s dancing.
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And she has had
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesnâ€™t move and doesnâ€™t breathe;
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novelâ€™s crank.
And she, as if sheâ€™s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
And she, that young and lovely creature;
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
And slowly through fields sheâ€™s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
And so grew they old both.
And stands at stint
And stilly does she say at last:
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, sheâ€™s free.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet sheâ€™s sighing once again
And Tatyanaâ€™s nervous
And that... but afterwards youâ€™ll know, Is not it true?
And then at prince she was adjusting
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
And then he dressed himself...
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
And then I thought: Heâ€™s now in;
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
And thereâ€¦ -
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, heâ€™s being in a whim.
And unattentive smart lornette.
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
And what can give me fate of mine?â€™
And what for is can now lurid?
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
And what.
And what?
And what?
And what?
And what? -
And whatâ€™s Onegin doing?
And whatâ€™s the reason?
And when a falling shining star
And when sometimes in front of her
And where everythingâ€™s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
And where is her sister line?
˜And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.â€™.
And whispered her each one of them: â€˜You look left side at those menâ€¦â€™
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madmanâ€™s hearty mock.
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
And who, dâ€™you think, from it is looking?
˜And whom your lovely verse adored?â€™
˜And whom?â€™ - Sheâ€™s Larinâ€™s. -
And with a bow
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
And with Oneginâ€™s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And wondered: would he be alive?â€™
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
And you forgive, my freedom later!
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
And you, â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
And. so cunny, she is gay. Alreadyâ€™s able to betray!
And. told her:
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
Andâ€¦ he could not.
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but donâ€™t we. confess.
Appoloâ€™s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we canâ€™t endure,
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Are silent.
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Oneginâ€™s eyes make tire own,
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
Arid, following Petrarkaâ€™s tracks, Could calm his heartâ€™s the biggest trouble.
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
As at the reason of the parting Tatyanaâ€™s grumbling at the brook,
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didnâ€™t want
As I to loose my freedom feared Whichâ€™s hateful to my own will.
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, whoâ€™s lost in thought,
As if by greenish down covered.
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
As legends say of old age (For that weâ€™d praise in him the sage).
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
As object of the judging noisy, In life youâ€™d never have a wish:
As pawn thatâ€™s worth of dear mate.
As quick as can
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
As sign of friendshipâ€™s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
As they are mean and simple features, You wonâ€™t see fine art in that.
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..â€™
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizonâ€™s foolish brightnessâ€™.
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
At any sides weâ€™ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
At boring auntâ€™s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
At brook the monument is seeing Sheâ€™s drawing made of leather rein,
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
˜At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
At fire-place the tableâ€™s lain: Oneginâ€™s waiting - Lenskyâ€™s speeding
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
At first his language me confused,
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame Youâ€™d guess, as I would well behave
At first of them she didnâ€™t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
At first theyâ€™d nothing seen In common.
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
At gooseâ€™s neck a skull is fateful, Itâ€™s whirling round for all sides;
At her much frightened loud cries
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
At him she stares all the way:
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
At KharitÃ³nyaâ€™s in the alley In front of house at the gate
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on tableâ€™s falling
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtainâ€™s moving
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
At last it stopped.
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
At last sheâ€™s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
At margins of the books sheâ€™s meeting Of readerâ€™s pencil slightest signs:
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret tormentâ€™s gladness...
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
At neighbourâ€™s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: â€˜Iâ€™ve my happy days...â€™
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
At other kinds of lines.
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricksâ€¦
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
At Simeonâ€™s heâ€™s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
At sister Tanya isnâ€™t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
At such a year, such an age.
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
At the beginning of my novel â€” (In chapter first you look it all)
At the games of maidenhood.
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
At usual hour stirred up, In candleâ€™s light sheâ€™s getting up.
At Verreyâ€™s every morningâ€™s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
At window alone, sad (Dianaâ€™s ray lights up, her wakens)
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
At window she now sits.
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
Away from Eugeneâ€™s lips; morose, Heâ€™s awkward, hardly has he force
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
Baratynsky.
Be glad with such a manâ€¦ You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
Became alredy quite inapt.
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Because ire, truthfulness sheâ€™s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forestâ€™s thicks?
Because sheâ€™s innocent and plain,
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
Before arrival; anyhow She isnâ€™t bothered (thatâ€™s female!);
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun heâ€™s looking on...
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Behind the mill.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
Believe, Iâ€™d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
Bewildered and astonished hard...
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
Boom could fade.
˜Bordeauxâ€™ all the times!
Brothers!
But after first cordial greeting Zaretskyâ€™s silent for a while
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
˜But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young loverâ€™s lot:
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
But are you listening yet to me?
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
But at least
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
But by your narrow small tracks,
But canâ€™t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
But canâ€™t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hadesâ€™ spectres
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runsâ€¦ the bearâ€™s after her!
But dangerous for the maidenâ€™s heart) Quite reddenning heâ€™s missing up.
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future wonâ€™t be
˜But do you love, indeed, the other?â€™ -And what? -
But doesnâ€™t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
But Eugeneâ€™s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
But even such a friendship, readers, We havenâ€™t now; each of us
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
But forward, forward, you, my story!
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
But hero, Iâ€™m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
But heâ€™s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
But his such sufferable shade,
But hist!
˜But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?â€™
˜But how did you marry, nanny?â€™ -It was by wish of God.
But how greatly Tanyaâ€™s altered!
But Hymenâ€™s troubles, griefs of mating,
But I
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isnâ€™t easy.
But I can hardly drag my feet,
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, Youâ€™ll never leave me such unfit.
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
But in gloomy cliffs
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
But it is late, itâ€™s time to go...
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
But itâ€™s enough to speak of her:
˜But Iâ€™d prefer another,
But Iâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t bother me: To old times Iâ€™ll loyal be.
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyanaâ€™s husband just appears,
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
But landlords of the countryâ€™s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
But Latinâ€™s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
But let me help with sacred water.
But like a house all deserted Itâ€™s dark and still, and not by chance
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
But many days away could get
™But may be sheâ€™s in love?â€™ â€˜Who knows?
But may be those kinds of pictures By now canâ€™t you all attract,
But my fate
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
But never wanted to correct; To censorship Iâ€™ll pay my debt;
But no answer...
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
-But no one...
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
But none she had!
But now - God! - is cooling blood
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
But now doubts all are solved:
But now radiant moonâ€™s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
˜But now tell;â€™ she says, â€˜to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?â€™
But now, friends, from all my sides -
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
But now...
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
But other times in mind I bear!
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: Whatâ€™s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
But really?
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
But road alarm of love then filled me.
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
But send your boy, and first of allâ€™ .
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
But shall I see you?â€™ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
But She whom I yet donâ€™t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
But sheâ€™s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
But something more us separated...
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet sheâ€™s looking rather slim;
But soon for husband, all at once,
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse alreadyâ€™s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, itâ€™s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
But suddenly her sisterâ€™s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
But suddenly was changed it all:
But summerâ€™s flying quicker yet.
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
But Tanya now like in dream
But Tanyaâ€™s heart yet isnâ€™t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
But thatâ€™s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
But then a frenchman took her place.
But then with books she could be dealing.
But then your horse will try in fear
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
˜But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
˜But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
But they would madden it too hard.
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
But to no person In all the world Iâ€™d give my heart,
˜But trouble is: they are such boresâ€™.
But uncoordinated volumes From devilâ€™s library all got,
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
But well, its time I should be busy: The beautyâ€™s letter I should use.
But well, sheâ€™s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sisterâ€™s pretty grace,
-But what about?
-But what is it -
But what Iâ€™d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
But what severe!
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
But where are you? Come! My rights
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
But where now through them speeds
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..â€™
˜But who is she?â€™ She is my wife,
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
˜But who? plump general that big?â€™
But whom to love?
But why Talyana should be guilty?
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
But why? I donâ€™t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
But will it come, my day of freedom?
But with Tatyana shanâ€™t we guess.
But withered!
But wretched is, whoâ€™s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
But yet she canâ€™t.
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures wonâ€™t be the best.
But you are pale... What are you feeling? â€˜Itâ€™s nothing, nanny, not at all.
But you are tortured by the road.
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
But, seems to me Iâ€™d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
BuyÃ¡nov courted: was refused.
BuyÃ¡nov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
By bondage Lenskyâ€™s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
By clear smile the natureâ€™s fitting Through dream the yearâ€™s morning meeting
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, sheâ€™s standing still.
By dreadful exclamation Oneginâ€™s shuddered; slain, impatient
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
By got by Olga strange tuition Sheâ€™s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
By habits of the life heâ€™s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novelâ€™s beings,
By hard from big TambÃ³vâ€™s engaged; BuyhÃ¡nov whirls with PustyakÃ³va,
By him were left at your employments.
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
By many signs sheâ€™s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With GÃ¶ttingen in soul frankly,
By new one canâ€™t I be admired I pity old one - itâ€™s true.
By nightâ€™s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
By nothing bound, Iâ€™m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
By Olgaâ€™s hand the teaâ€™s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyanaâ€™s standing, Sheâ€™s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted windowâ€™s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
By sorcery of storyâ€™s secrets!
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness whoâ€™s admired?
By winter carpets, snow-made.
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
Byron
Came in.
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
Canâ€™t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
˜...canâ€™t sleep, itâ€™s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...â€™
Canâ€™t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;

Child-Haroldâ€™s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forestâ€™s still
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didnâ€™t join the guild existent
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw oneâ€™s gaze,
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Could me enjoy... Iâ€™ve had my fill; It is enough!
Could my Onegin now find.
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
Dear! come to rueâ€¦ As in a dream it seems to be...
Decayed...
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
Decided is.
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winterâ€™s bliss and tinges all:
Deserted room alone filling You read; itâ€™s Pradt, itâ€™s Walter Scott.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
Dianaâ€™s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
Did try to make of that some fun: The countryâ€™s freedom has its own
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Dmitriyev.
Do comme il fautâ€¦ (Shishkov, forgive; canâ€™t some good translation give).
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
Do not reflect Dianaâ€™s features, Recalling bygone novelâ€™s creatures,
˜Do not.â€™
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
Dâ€™you hear?
- Dâ€™you joke -
Dâ€™you know?...
Dâ€™you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
˜Dâ€™you think.â€™ indeed... suspicions anyâ€¦ But do you see...
Dâ€™you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?â€™
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
Each claps.
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
Each minute more is captivated By Olgaâ€™s beauty so young,
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
Each shutterâ€™s open, and dry
Each topicâ€™s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
Effects, but stepped away anew; Heâ€™s blessed much more, who never knew
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, heâ€™s admired;
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole worldâ€¦
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
˜Enough, get up, I now must
Enough, my dear...
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
Enough... and has been done the burden:
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Etcetera.
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
Eugeneâ€™s letter to Tatyana
Every country eater
Exactly...
Explain to you, do it frankly.
Expresses death but not the torture.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
Fille Ã©tait fille, elle Ã©tait amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maidenâ€™s dreams.
For all of that
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
For centures to make him known.
For changes fated anyhow...
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
For evening party...
For evening whist whoâ€™s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
For fair of the brides her bring,
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
For flying glory donâ€™t long.
For garden now we shall fleet In which sheâ€™s got with him to meet.
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
For her heâ€™s looking on... for nought...
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
For his delight were just awaiting.
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
For how long?
For husband then she was yet bride.
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soulâ€™s filled
For long has chance with us to be?
For long is weeping she this time.
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
For love sheâ€™s dedicated truly Like loyal child for motherâ€™s nest,
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
For nowhere am I smart...
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (Thatâ€™s all he knew in own world...)
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
˜For single winter it will do, At least Iâ€™ll credit money youâ€™â€¦
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
For tears, rhymes and so on?â€¦ Present me herâ€™.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
˜For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
For theatre Oneginâ€™s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
For thoughtful singing with attention?â€™
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
For what and where do I strive?
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadnâ€™t time
For you the glory and the laud, The fatherâ€™s land, incarceration?
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanyaâ€™s dear heart indeed.
˜Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
Forgive me, isnâ€™t it too hard?â€™ -For me itâ€™s not - â€˜But dear bard,
Forgive meâ€™.
Forgive!
˜Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
Forgotten features can remind.
Four fatal for the life the stages...
Â«FreischutzÂ» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
From bed Onegin wasnâ€™t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
From glass not stopping For a whileâ€™. He never kisses hands of ladies,
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
From mountains descends this way
From novelâ€™s only beginning â€” Iâ€™ve finished now chapter one.
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy PetushkÃ³v,
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages donâ€™t want.
Go on!
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Goodness me!
Goodness me, it isnâ€™t For him to hear!
Grand treatyâ€™s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
Great charm to any conversation.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children youâ€™d be seeing
Griboyedov
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Haphazard wander to prevent.
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
Has come; to servant says he will Lepageâ€™s fatal barrels steady
Has fallenâ€¦
Has found end untimely hard!
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maidenâ€™s.
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altarâ€™s gone.
Have been decayed in natureâ€™s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
Have less in difference between Each one.
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
He came, What news, such sentimental!
He canâ€™t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
He canâ€™t give happiness at largeâ€™.
He cast a glance at ladiesâ€™ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
He couldnâ€™t be a bard for ever, He didnâ€™t go mad or die,
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she canâ€™t have breath..
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
He didnâ€™t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
He didnâ€™t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
He differed people in effect, And otherâ€™s passions could respect.
He doesnâ€™t gather them with horn. A maidenâ€™s singing in her house,
He doesnâ€™t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
He hasnâ€™t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
He hurries up to ring.
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
He isnâ€™t here...
He isnâ€™t moreâ€¦ The youngling bard
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
He liked the groveâ€™s timid thickness,
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
He looks al her with tender ardour; Heâ€™s yet beloved with previous force,
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
He looks, he calls him - allâ€™s for nothing!
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
He made me love him with insistence And couldnâ€™t find some better test.
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
He opened a door."
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
He shouts: â€˜Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tamaâ€™s heart.
He slept and coffee had he here, His menagerâ€™s reports could hear,
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drumsâ€™s beat.
He stepped away... he turned a bit..â€™-
He thinks of here:
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
He trembles... to princess heâ€™s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
He was afraid of being answered
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
He was mistaken: sleeping fair â€” Onegin then for world was dead,
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasnâ€™t right at all
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kantâ€™s ideas and his moves.
He, might be, for the worldâ€™s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
Healthy all...
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
Her head to shoulderâ€™s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
Her husband comes.
Her husbandâ€™s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Her maidenâ€™s mirror yet she keeps.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
Her role how firmly played,
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
Her tender fingers didnâ€™t dare To take a needle; she could never
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Her tired look and slipped away...
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
˜Hereâ€™s He! thatâ€™s Eugene!
Heâ€™ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
Heâ€™ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
Heâ€™s always frowned, taciturn, Heâ€™s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
Heâ€™s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
Heâ€™s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! Heâ€™s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
Heâ€™s blessed, who with his love combined
Heâ€™s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
Heâ€™s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
Heâ€™s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
Heâ€™s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
™Heâ€™s ignoramusâ€™, said the neighbours, â€™He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
Heâ€™s killed!..
Heâ€™s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
Heâ€™s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
Heâ€™s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
Heâ€™s not been seen, none word from dear;
Heâ€™s now languished by remorse, Heâ€™s being ready to beg pardon,
Heâ€™s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lenskyâ€™s head For sufferings, he here had.
Heâ€™s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
Heâ€™s trembling, loses fitting words, Heâ€™s happy, has improved his health,
Heâ€™s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
His ardent talk was full of haze;
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
His epigramâ€™s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
His father didnâ€™t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
His letterâ€™s here, quite exact.
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
His lifeâ€™s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
His look was always quick and tender,
His lunch him answered with politeness.
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
His misty, foggy gaze
His morbid and quite dying look,
His nets for them were so frightening!
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
His Olgaâ€™s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
His own works?
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
His pistol then Onegin raises
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
His soulâ€™s warmed with inspiration By ladyâ€™s greetings, friendly kind.
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each otherâ€™s brains;
His verse is sluggish and obscure (Itâ€™s called romanticism by us;
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -

I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
I ask: be patient for a time;
I can foresee: youâ€™ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
I canâ€™t foresee any objection To this representation made.
I canâ€™t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
I could define
I didnâ€™t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
I donâ€™t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
I donâ€™t grudge: why should I grudge?
˜I donâ€™t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
I donâ€™t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
I donâ€™t mean to please grand people.
I dread to read again...
I dread: in my submissive prayers Youâ€™ll see by strict, severe gaze
˜I fell in love... youâ€™d get away
˜I fell in loveâ€™, again she whispers In nurseâ€™s ear in dismay.
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
I had happened To know many old legends,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
I have without any doubts Tatyanaâ€™s letter to translate.
I havenâ€™t force... is tired breastâ€¦
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
I know, you were sent by goodness, Youâ€™ll be my guard until the end,
I know: Parnyâ€™s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
I like teenageâ€™s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
I liked his features in the past:
I live and write not for applause,
I love him, heâ€™s my kin in-law.
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used Iâ€™d run from you;
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armidâ€™s pretty lips,
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
I prize my hours, my days: But Iâ€™m in idle boredom wasting
I saw myself in cherished dream
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
I see you strong already!
˜I see, in world youâ€™ve been too rare...
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
I stop!
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what dâ€™you think? again collapse!â€™
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
I was embittered, heâ€¦ unfit.
I was his friend some while ago.
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
I was taking you in hands!
˜I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
I write it, as for long my time I havenâ€™t any sin of mine.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
I write, and heart yet isnâ€™t boring, The pen unwitting isnâ€™t drawing
I â€” It sparkles by Hippocreneâ€™s role, It was by own play and foam
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldnâ€™t tell meanwhile.
Ideal image, Tanyaâ€™s rhyme...
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
If by the family best vision For instant Iâ€™d be charmed with reason,-
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
If I were poet like you.
˜If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
If not... if not, let God deliver!
If sheâ€™s seeing
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
If their district visits on?
If you could know, whatâ€™s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,

Imagine: Iâ€™m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
Importantly repeats for doll The motherâ€™s lessons, though small.
Impossible!?
In actions husbandâ€™s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
In all of them restrictionâ€™s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
˜In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
In bookâ€™s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
In brackets I would like to note: You havenâ€™t more insulting lie,
In brackets to the point Iâ€™d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
In country tediumâ€™s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
In countryâ€™s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
In crowd everybody renders:
In dark my Tanyaâ€™s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
In deserts of the heavenâ€™s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
In duels classic, pedant cross
In early spring of every year.
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But letâ€™s return to lady sitting.
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
In fear I was crying, darling,
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
In front of him gay fancyâ€™s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isnâ€™t fading,
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
In hands I have Tatyanaâ€™s letter. Itâ€™s kept by me with sacred sigh.
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashionâ€™s duty,
In his first youth he was untrained,
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
In horror Tanya is awaking...
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
In languish of the loving bounds Heâ€™s spending now day and night.
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
In letters though he again
In life with us like new itâ€™s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
In many trends heâ€™d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
In manâ€™s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soulâ€™s quiet dream.
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirrorâ€™s aiming down,
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
In own dreams allâ€™s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
In sledge heâ€™s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself Iâ€™ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
In talks allâ€™s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In Tanyaâ€™s, Olgaâ€™s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
In tender manner they agree.
In them he draws the country whole, The Kypridâ€™s temple, graves alone:
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
In them Iâ€™ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
In them you canâ€™t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
-In this I see yet no troublesâ€¦
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
In vain I try to be aware,
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you Iâ€™d never know, thus I wouldnâ€™t know tortures sleepless.
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
In winter, when the nightâ€™s weak shade
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
In young sad soulâ€™s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
Indeed, by magnetismâ€™s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
Indeed, dâ€™you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
Indeed, for long should have the end!
Indeed, heâ€™s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
Indeed, you wonâ€™t With all your pure flaming heart
˜Indeed? - my Eugeneâ€™s now thinking, - But is it true?..
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shillerâ€™s work.
Invitations for a meeting?
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
Is cunning liric, who can render
Is drawn, in turn Iâ€™ve bad nay time.
Is flying from the waxy cell.
is going, and when sheâ€™s trying To turn aside... is coming up
Is he a parody not yet?
Is he the same or quiet now?
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
Is it because in higher circles
Is it high time as I forgot
Is it not
Is not it so, friend?
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Is really the secretâ€™s found?
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
Is spoiled by old duels fan, Heâ€™s evil, gossip, talking man...
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
Is whitening on LukÃ©rya Lvovna, The same yet lies LytibÃ³v PetrÃ³vna.
IstÃ³minaâ€™s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
It all is still.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his motherâ€™s finger shakes.
It in strain
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
It is forgivable.
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I canâ€™t be appraising,
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
It means the following thing mainly:
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
It might he other: heâ€™d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
It now; but â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mindâ€™s the secret backs.
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
It was well known friendly wellcome:
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
Italian nights I shall adore.
Its dark.
Its here: take it and be â€˜tacklingâ€™ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her itâ€™s all the same.
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!â€™
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss theyâ€™ve had;
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
Itâ€™s all decided (itâ€™s my version) By heavens board: Iâ€™m yours at heart.
Itâ€™s better place for passing letters fit.
Itâ€™s both harmful and absorbing.
Itâ€™s dark in valleys.
Itâ€™s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
Itâ€™s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
Itâ€™s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Itâ€™s late.
˜Itâ€™s mine!â€™ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
Itâ€™s mute for ever all at once.
Itâ€™s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
Itâ€™s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
-itâ€™s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
Itâ€™s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
Itâ€™s right.
˜Itâ€™s seven soon, itâ€™s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to waitâ€™.

Â«Itâ€™s time to change them in a body,
Itâ€™s time to leave for life the tight
Itâ€™s time, its time to marry her!
Itâ€™s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
Itâ€™s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
Itâ€™s winter!..

˜Iâ€™ll be defender; Iâ€™ll not endure when offender
˜Iâ€™ll perish, - says my Tanyaâ€™s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.

-Iâ€™m glad. - â€˜but when?â€™ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
Iâ€™m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
Iâ€™m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
˜Iâ€™m neighbour justâ€™.
˜Iâ€™m not quite made to be much happy. My soulâ€™s alien for bliss;
Iâ€™m sorry that you goâ€¦ well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
Iâ€™m unknown...
Iâ€™ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you Iâ€™m dangling:
Iâ€™ve heard some voice of new desire, Iâ€™ve got new sorrow anew;
Iâ€™ve read it up:

Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
Letâ€™s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
Letâ€™s come together... take a rest...
Letâ€™s go, do thorn such a favour!

Like Byron, poet of grace. Or itâ€™s impossible or faithless
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while heâ€™s sleeping,
Like crank by chance at feast enormous Heâ€™s angry.
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Like Harold Child Oneginâ€™s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
Like in van Dickâ€™s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, sheâ€™s boon
Like Julieâ€™s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
Like North Auroraâ€™s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winterâ€™s even every way.
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Like thoughts of simple ladyâ€™s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
Like victim under charming veil.
Like women, books were all left here,
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.

Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
Maidenâ€™s singing intimate, Donâ€™t peep invisibly
Maidenâ€™s Song
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isnâ€™t frozen by frost.

Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
Marmontelâ€™s volume them he gave.
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
May be, you saw at Nevaâ€™s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.

-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
My Lenskyâ€™s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
My memory is dark.., Iâ€™m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
My Moscow... in this lunation
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
My muse in ethics well embodied!
My muse new person just reveals.
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;

New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
New way Iâ€™m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
Next day has come...
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
None soulâ€™s seen in rooms at entrance...
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness Sheâ€™d catch oneâ€™s eyes by simple face.
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
Nor makes get up without choosing.
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Ladyâ€™s Fashion Journal had
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
Not a word can slip
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles bringsâ€™
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
Not Eugene heâ€™s at most?
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
Not grasping ways to understand
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Not madrigals my Lenskyâ€™s writing In Olgaâ€™s album, and indeed
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education canâ€™t adhere
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
- Not, then!
Not...

O Russia!

Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
Of balletâ€™s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladiesâ€™ hearts.
Of bold childrenâ€™s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired FlyÃ¡nov,
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maidenâ€™s album big,
Of course, he thinks, â€˜I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Of course, of him Iâ€™ll quickly know,- For him I now havenâ€™t time.
Of course, Oneginâ€™s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
Of daily troubles.
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Of elegyâ€™s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Of enemy from pistol parried.
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
Of grievous notes of the heart.
Of higher world the queer ladies!
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Of humble girl some secret love?
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pullâ€¦
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
Of known ladies feet and legs.
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But itâ€™s a stress
Of legislator of the halls?
Of life her features have but few.
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
Of lively lucid verseâ€™s glow,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
Of looking back she doesnâ€™t dare And hurries up, sheâ€™s quickening steps,
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
Of love mad sufferings sheâ€™s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendshipâ€™s heavy haze?
Of men, whom I canâ€™t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
Of mind some cold observations,
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintlyâ€™.
Of Moscow young graces good
Of multiplied his own crank.
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didnâ€™t come at all to him
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
Of own life he could forget!
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
Of poet, whoâ€™s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
Of praised grandfatherâ€™s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the countryâ€™s still!
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Of Russian Terpsichoreâ€™s dear
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
Of stylish words some ready set?
Of tears tracks?..
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend Iâ€™m now singing,
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
˜Of them my Olga is the younger.
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead youâ€™ll give a hope;
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of tyrant you didnâ€™t fear, But now he your fate has had.
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
Of what a languorâ€™s full her breast?
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughterâ€™s bed till day was dreaming
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
˜Of whom your own lyre sighs?â€™ By you Iâ€™m often briskly questioned, -
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
Of yard boys family just flies.
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of young delirium high rage.
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journalâ€™s call:
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Of â€˜Clicquot widowâ€™ or â€˜Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
Oh, donâ€™t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snowâ€™s filthy
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
On earth, then might be by her love Sheâ€™d joined the friends the day above!
On jade postillionâ€™s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beardâ€™s shaggy.
On leave the gussars hasten here
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
On riverâ€™s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid letâ€™s have dinner before rest!
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanyaâ€™s shoulder he bends;
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, Heâ€™s taking home dreadful hoard,
On steps of world the bard might go
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
On tableâ€™s hissing yet, forlorn...
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
Onegin got Tatyanaâ€™s message. It quickly touched his soulâ€™s strings:
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-riverâ€™s banks.
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
˜Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
Onegin.
Oneginâ€™s coining with excuses.
Oneginâ€™s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Oneginâ€™s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Oneginâ€™s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
Oneginâ€™s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
Oneginâ€™s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
Oneginâ€™s quick to dress. Already His sernantâ€™s ordered to be ready
Oneginâ€™s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
Oneginâ€™s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
Oneâ€™s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!

Presents his friend and distant kin.
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
Princess is staring at him...
- Princess, mon ange! -
Princess, undone yet before him
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
Ran up and not without fighting
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
Regards of them to you Iâ€™m giving.
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaidâ€™s.
Reminiscence of old time, Of maidenâ€™s room!
Replace the fortune.
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
Rousseau (Iâ€™d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
Ruslanâ€™s, Lyudmilaâ€™s friends!
Sad and cold,
Says yes or no, never Ð´Ð°-Ñ Or Ð½ÐµÑ‚-Ñâ€™(the words, they all would pass).
˜Sed alia temporalâ€™ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
˜Shall go forth or should return?..
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
Shall see emotional flight?
˜Shall we begin?â€™ â€˜Perhaps,â€™ says Lensky.
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
She courtedâ€¦ at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
She doesnâ€™t glare at the rest, And doesnâ€™t claim to have success;
She doesnâ€™t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
She doesnâ€™t say: â€˜Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
She doesnâ€™t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isnâ€™t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
She doesnâ€™t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
She enters a deserted yard.
She falls on snow - he is swifty: Heâ€™s taking her in paws and brings,
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
She hurries up to have a chat.
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
She looks, and all her own heart More oftenâ€™s heating and more hard.
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
She runs for forest... heâ€™s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
She sees: the room is light again, Through windowâ€™s a frosty pane
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinterâ€™s crackling making light.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
She thinks:
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian â€œÐ½â€ in French best manner
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
She went away.
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
Sheâ€™s after me.
Sheâ€™s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
Sheâ€™s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
Sheâ€™s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
Sheâ€™s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
Sheâ€™s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
Sheâ€™s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
Sheâ€™s not astonished, hasnâ€™t anger...
Sheâ€™s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldnâ€™t give a hoot..
Sheâ€™s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
Sheâ€™s running - he is after her; She canâ€™t be running any more,
Sheâ€™s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Sheâ€™s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
Sheâ€™s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
Sheâ€™s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesnâ€™t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
Sheâ€™s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
Sheâ€™s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foeâ€™s hand
Sheâ€™s up at once, Like shade sheâ€™s pale, but no answer...
Sheâ€™s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, sheâ€™s often frightened,
Sheâ€™s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugeneâ€™s kept in mind,
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
Should I begin my freedom flight.
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Sincerely, in grief embracing
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
Some balls, one childrenâ€™s entertainment...
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: â€˜Ah!â€™ But he becomes
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Nevaâ€™s stream,
Some cold wind just blows.
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
Some loss in all the songâ€™s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
Some noise by beetleâ€™s raised.
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Some other...
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
Some real honour and the pride.
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
Some several miles from KrasnogÃ³ry, From Lenskyâ€™s village, there lives
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
Some tears shed at urn my early: â€˜He tell in love with me,â€™ to thinks
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
Sometimes sheâ€™s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola Iâ€™ll travel
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To ladyâ€™s album if by chance,
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
Sometimes, when heâ€™s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
Such charming, tender.
Such customâ€™s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
Such men (Iâ€™m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
Such subjectâ€™s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
Such time what can you do in village?
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
˜Tanya though!â€™ â€˜Dâ€™you know her?-
Tanya, near!
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesnâ€™t know why)
Tatyana hadnâ€™t any trends To play with them in any weather:
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this worldâ€™s fuss sheâ€™s hatred feeling.
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letterâ€™s trembling on her palm, The waferâ€™s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Tatyana steeps.
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
Tatyana trusted legendâ€™s fancies Of simple folkâ€™s old times.
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
Tatyanaâ€™s flushing, all sheâ€™s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Tatyanaâ€™s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
Tatyanaâ€™s letter to Onegin.
Tatyanaâ€™s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Tatyanaâ€™s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
Tell again, You see, Iâ€™m now muddle-headed.
Thank God, more clearly - sheâ€™s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
That dream aroused her misgivings.
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
That heâ€™s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
That instant I could trunk with reason
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
That recently I was you christening?â€™
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
That time to all my childish dreams
That time, when in lyceumâ€™s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
That uhlanâ€™s loved by all her soulâ€¦ At altar now does she stand
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
That was the way of Eugeneâ€™s thinking.
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
Thatâ€™s what I am.
Thatâ€™s why in French sheâ€™s always writing.
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
The autumn golden is coming, The natureâ€™s now trembling, pale
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
The beds are made. And any guest
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
The boy was frisky but with grace.
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
The capitalâ€™s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. â€” Hut now simply good the head
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
The clockâ€™s been striking
The coachmanâ€™s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
The colonel sent it for the chance.
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
The day had gone, but no answer...
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
The doubts all confused her soul:
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
THE END
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
The enmityâ€™s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
The evening darkness comes along...
The evening skyâ€™s more dark.
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
The field is dark in pretty gale...
The fire-place is fading...
The fireâ€™s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coalâ€™s crust;
The first he made - he left you all;
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
The first of leaflets just can show: Quâ€™ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
The fisherâ€™s fire.
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
The foes put the capes on steppe.
The foes!
The follyâ€™s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
The further Iâ€™m from youth my gay,
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
The girls are jumping all around.
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
The Gulnareâ€™s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasnâ€™t smoothed by any chance:
The hall is full of crowd; The musicâ€™s weary of sound;
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquetâ€™s cracks wee heard again.
The hamlet, where Eugeneâ€™s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
The head of Chaldean wise men, â€” Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
The heart of somebody heâ€™ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
The heavenâ€™s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
The inns are absent.
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horsesâ€™ stallâ€¦â€™
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasnâ€™t right.
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier sheâ€™s liking us,
The letterâ€™s ready, has been fit...
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you Iâ€™m staunch a friend.
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
The loveâ€™s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
The masterâ€™s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
The mistress cries, â€˜At last youâ€™ve got!â€™
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields sheâ€™s now looking:
The morning pleasant noise arose.
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!â€™â€¦ -To whom, my dear?
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heavenâ€™s blue
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heavenâ€™s bodies light
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
The novelty with ages smacks.
The novelâ€™s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga PetushkÃ³v then whirls,
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
The pistols all are now shining, The hammerâ€™s jingling at the lock,
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
The prince as if anew him sees:
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larinâ€™s soon forever went:
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The same I was in time of wisdom,
The same is dog, the sameâ€™s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
The seasons country views
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
The shades of night are now rare And Vesperâ€™s met by cock ahead.
The shepherdâ€™s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
The shining skies are now blued.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it heâ€™s flying to the mill;
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
The snow-drift at once is moving...
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at riverâ€™s banks they fall.
The snowâ€™s crackling... someoneâ€™s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
The snowâ€™s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
The spring of honour, idol last!
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
The talkative my lyreâ€™s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
The tears of the peopleâ€™s awe. Katenin there could restore
The teaâ€™s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutletâ€™s fat at once,
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
The vice, thatâ€™s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
The waters Are still.
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
The way to keep her man away! And everything became oâ€™key.
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
The wish of heart to whisper her.
The withering of own days, Which canâ€™t revive by any ways?
The woman says:
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
The youthful years would be fading, The soulâ€™s heat would not be hot
The â€˜elseâ€™s trendsâ€™, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maidenâ€™s names by names from France,
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
Then he for her a chairâ€™s finding, They speak about this and that,
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
Then weâ€™ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
˜There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!â€™
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
They all replaced for each of roberts; The teaâ€™s been brought.
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
They argue louder; heâ€™s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
They didnâ€™t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
They donâ€™t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
They donâ€™t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
They friends became.
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfastâ€™s ready in the room.
They joked, not without sin At Tanyaâ€™s suitor made a hint.
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
They rush into the yard at once!
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
They say, theyâ€™d got For that the best in world reward.
They say, you are a lone guy, In countryâ€™s stillness you are boring.
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
Theyâ€™d better laugh before they had
Theyâ€™ve made me marry other man; And Iâ€™ll be true to him till end!
This kind of book yet doesnâ€™t show The writerâ€™s fancies in a row,
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests itâ€™s always zealous,
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Three houses will wait for him.
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for riverâ€™s crook.
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
Through tears never seeing him,
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
To answer her.
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistolâ€™s cock.
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
To be with you I cannot go...
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasnâ€™t grasping.
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
To call some people gets away.
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
To come to tables hand in hand.
To comfort sorrow and grief.
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
To cry, to weep Iâ€™m now ready...â€™ -I see, you are unwell already
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
To fix her fate itâ€™s time, I see;
To get him up she isnâ€™t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student heâ€™s a dunce.
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
To guess the windy youth is trying
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
To have a rest and have a hike, Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll finish other time.
To have a talk with her he tried
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
To have remorse I havenâ€™t forces; Like Bogdanovichâ€™s all verses Iâ€™d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have youâ€™d like, Or Eden to itselfâ€™s unlike.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
To him she doesnâ€™t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
To hostess a ladyâ€™s heading, Some plump grand generalâ€™s behind.
To inner porch he goes fast, Heâ€™s laying down her at last.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
To judgings by the world severe
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
-To Larinâ€™s -â€™Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings dailyâ€¦
To leave the world I would he sorry.
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
To loose his colour heâ€™s beginning: She doesnâ€™t see or sheâ€™s too hard!?
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
To make your dear magic tuning Of beautyâ€™s passion mood, resuming
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!â€™
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
To me that time you were quite right,â€™ To you is grateful soul mine...
To me true compass now lend
˜To me you wrote, Do not deny.
˜To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
To meet princess.
To meet the scholar worldâ€™s desire I could describe, youâ€™d be amazed.
To Moscow, they need good things.â€™..,
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
To other things letâ€™s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
To PetushkÃ³v she never goes; PykhtÃ­n, the hussar, toed to fuse
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olgaâ€™s frock.
To play the cards was used with me.
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
To protests of soulâ€™s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didnâ€™t read,
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesnâ€™t slumber,
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!â€™
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
To scratch unfaithful icy path As heâ€™s afraid to fall at last.
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, Iâ€™d like to write,
To take it up she canâ€™t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
To Talonâ€™s surely heâ€™s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
To tell you all, what he had known, I havenâ€™t any time at all.
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
To them He paid his all attention then.
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
To touch in splendid admiration.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
To walk?
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
˜To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?â€™
To whom my vice is not a harm?
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
To you Iâ€™ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
To you Iâ€™m greatful!
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
To-morrow weâ€™ll Tanya show...
Together for a time they sit.
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressedÂ».
Too long the silenceâ€™s now seeming...
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence nowâ€™s keeping.
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Two pistols in a row,
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Unlucky victim, Lenskyâ€™s gone...
Unmoving, lone heâ€™s again.
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy browâ€™s languid peace.
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: Heâ€™s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Unwittingly in mirrorâ€™s peeping Ashamed to recognize: heâ€™s beaten;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
Upstairs to the highest rate.

Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
˜Vladimir Lensky hereâ€™s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
Was asking Olya him at once
Was brave instead of â€˜elle Ninaâ€™ To put the â€˜belle Tatianaâ€™
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, Weâ€™ll call him dandy for the forth.
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
Was shaking. Due to Zues heâ€™s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Was talking much of them with pride.
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
Was too afraid, I must confess...
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
We havenâ€™t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
We knew the game of passionâ€™s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
We must meanwhile
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
We them remind about us...
Well dressed, sheâ€™s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Well have the music regimental!
˜Well, dear me, what is the matter?
˜Well, he is killedâ€™,- the neighbour said.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, itâ€™s quite distressing
Well, I remember... has he gone?
Well, I saluted classicism! Itâ€™s late, but preface has been seen.
˜Well, let us goâ€¦â€™ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
˜Well, no, just the same...
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
Well, to present you I shall tryâ€™
˜Well... I, my nannyâ€¦ donâ€™t know... For love Iâ€™m longing, dear me!
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soulâ€™s haze.
Weâ€™ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
What a whim...
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
˜What big is Tanya!
What blunder! Iâ€™m a punished ranger.
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
What do you want to ask, you say!
What does next day for me prepare?
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
What for to grieve?
What for would ever view
What for yet here has he been?
˜What for you early disappeared?â€™
What for you visited all us?
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
What is your name? - Heâ€™s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphonâ€¦
What joy: to-day weâ€™ll have to dance!
What kindâ€™s he now anyhow?
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
What more you want?
What purpose?
What roses, you can be judging,
-What said the satirist, remember!
What shall I do, I canâ€™t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
˜What slow-witted you are, nyanya!â€™ -Iâ€™m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barinâ€™s will Iâ€™d ratherâ€¦-
What was the sequence of the meeting?
˜What way?
What will he choose for his engagement?
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
˜What, you are married! didnâ€™t know!
What?
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, Iâ€™d like with you
˜Whatâ€™s happened?â€™- `Nothingâ€™â€¦ - Gets away.
Whatâ€™s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
Whatâ€™s my Onegin?
Whatâ€™s the end?
Whatâ€™s use?
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
When heâ€™s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hareâ€™s trembling
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
When in the gardenâ€™s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshkyâ€™s sounds hear),
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
˜Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
Where is it better?
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?â€™
Where we have never been.
Whereâ€™s agitation And honourable aspiration
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
Which doesnâ€™t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I canâ€™t...
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Whichâ€™s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
While at the moon Tatyanaâ€™s looking, By own heart away sheâ€™s gone...
While he prefered to play a steed. His fingerâ€™s frozen a little,
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
While sheâ€™s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
˜Whith Olga what could happen?
Who carefully us can cherish?
Who fatherâ€™s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Who isnâ€™t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
Who left TambÃ³v without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
˜Who might be thinking... all the time!
Who never bores us by his charm?
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didlaâ€™s crowned there.
Whom donâ€™t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Whom youâ€™d be trusting?
Whose author bolter natureâ€™s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
™Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
Whoâ€™s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
Whoâ€™s he?
Whoâ€™s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Whoâ€™s that, which never us betrays?
Whoâ€™s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?â€™,
Whoâ€™s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
Why not? Itâ€™s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
Why! out of the country thickets...â€™
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards theyâ€™ll not endure
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
Will show my renowned face And say: â€˜Itâ€™s poet of grace!â€™
Will take the twilight of my days.
With age the life is such a badness...â€™
With age to argue is unfitness; The customâ€™s despot of the males.
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
With blood sustained each pure hand... Theyâ€™d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
With clear soul
With dangerous book aloneâ€™s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
With dear muse of mine capricious Letâ€™s hear forestâ€™s noise delicious
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
With goatâ€™s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
With heavenly her pride sheâ€™s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
With her heâ€™s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarkaâ€™s language â€˜I love youâ€™ .
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
With him my cousin first BuyÃ¡nov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
With KharlikÃ³v PanfÃ­l and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
With kin to meet
With Lea, thatâ€™s given him too sweety; With ladiesâ€™ flatness; tunes of men;
With love friendsâ€™ notions Iâ€™d rate
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goetheâ€™s, Shinerâ€™s places hiking,
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
With might and main heâ€™ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isnâ€™t seeing;
With my request immodest, gladless Iâ€™d trouble you for helping me:
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
With one of feet the floor sheâ€™s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
With own heavy hall, his dear; GvozdÃ­n, BuyÃ¡nov, PetushkÃ³v
With own wife thatâ€™s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
With PelagÃ©ya NikolÃ¡vna The sameâ€™s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
With reason I remembered them.
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
With Tanya Lensky; KharlikÃ³va, The bride of more than ripening age,
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
With the berries laughingly, Donâ€™t hear secretly
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
With time Iâ€™d smooth and then might be Iâ€™d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
With war; with magazineâ€™s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
With which to start?
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
With yawn Iâ€™ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
With you I now tears shed;
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
Without answer.
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
Without fail youâ€™ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torchâ€™s rays;
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
Without them Onegmâ€™s pictured.
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;

- Yes and no yet.
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Yes, I shall come, Iâ€™ll come!â€™ - before
Yes, It is he...
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didnâ€™t play with doll;
Yet being child, in childrenâ€™s throng To play and jump had none desire,
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
Yet limpid is the near wood
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Yet outside, as wellâ€™s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
YIII
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
You alone Among anxieties in still
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
You are in heat.- - But Iâ€™m not ill Well... nanny, Iâ€™m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
You came two times, but then of self You donâ€™t make them yet reminding
You didnâ€™t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
You donâ€™t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
You donâ€™t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
You get along the Nevaâ€™s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
You give a pen and paper, dear, Iâ€™ll stay in bed; make table near;
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
You help my doubts to resolve:
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winterâ€™s mirth youâ€™d had.
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!â€™
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
You listen to my grievous call:
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
You must remember that day time,
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
You now bless long yearsâ€™ work
You now come to rooms, the inner...
˜You now meet...â€™ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
You poets, are queer!â€™ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
You see, by skies its predestined:
˜You see, Tatyanaâ€™s not a child,â€™ The old womanâ€™s voice is mild,-
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
˜You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!â€™
You take my set of florid rhymes
- You tell me, nanny,
˜You tell me, prince, if donâ€™t mind,
˜You tell of those Your old times... Iâ€™ve boring tide..â€™
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?â€™ -That girl, whichâ€™s always so sad;
You write the odes, gentlemen,
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
˜You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
Youâ€™d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
Youâ€™ll fall in love once more and findâ€¦ You learn to rule yourself: I fear
Youâ€™ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
Youâ€™ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
Youâ€™ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
Youâ€™ll see: they all become the bosh
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Zaretsky to behave refuses: â€˜But where is the second yours?â€™
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didnâ€™t want:
Zaretskyâ€™s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
ZarÃ©tsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
Zhizhi, my soulâ€™s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
Zhookovsky
œUncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew heâ€™d be gladâ€.























Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
O Russia!
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
Less influence on ladyâ€™s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
Was brave instead of â€˜elle Ninaâ€™ To put the â€˜belle Tatianaâ€™
Oh, donâ€™t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
Eugeneâ€™s letter to Tatyana
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
˜Pachette!â€™- Alina!
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
Is whitening on LukÃ©rya Lvovna, The same yet lies LytibÃ³v PetrÃ³vna.
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
Etcetera.
By hard from big TambÃ³vâ€™s engaged; BuyhÃ¡nov whirls with PustyakÃ³va,
˜Ah, Tanya!
˜What big is Tanya!
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
He was mistaken: sleeping fair â€” Onegin then for world was dead,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. â€” Hut now simply good the head
Oneâ€™s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
But wretched is, whoâ€™s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
To get him up she isnâ€™t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
The shades of night are now rare And Vesperâ€™s met by cock ahead.
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
A book at mornings here read...
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Letâ€™s read
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didnâ€™t read,
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winterâ€™s mirth youâ€™d had.
But none she had!
Thank God, more clearly - sheâ€™s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
Heâ€™s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lenskyâ€™s head For sufferings, he here had.
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
In Tanyaâ€™s, Olgaâ€™s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
Let it be so: you have had
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss theyâ€™ve had;
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Ladyâ€™s Fashion Journal had
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
And she has had
Of tyrant you didnâ€™t fear, But now he your fate has had.
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
And old barin room this had;
Theyâ€™d better laugh before they had
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
Itâ€™s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
But you are tortured by the road.
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
Across a glade, all under snow Around which allâ€™s dark and sad.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?â€™ -That girl, whichâ€™s always so sad;
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Tell again, You see, Iâ€™m now muddle-headed.
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Not madrigals my Lenskyâ€™s writing In Olgaâ€™s album, and indeed
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
Of elegyâ€™s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanyaâ€™s dear heart indeed.
Letâ€™s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
With you I now tears shed;
But suddenly her sisterâ€™s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
My muse in ethics well embodied!
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
Ah, many were by fate denied!
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
In many trends heâ€™d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
Of enemy from pistol parried.
By many signs sheâ€™s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
To have a talk with her he tried
Such customâ€™s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soulâ€™s filled
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
Heâ€™s killed!..
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: â€˜Well, heâ€™s killed...â€™
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
˜Ah, father my! the profitâ€™s worsened..â€™.
Sheâ€™s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, sheâ€™s often frightened,
Of praised grandfatherâ€™s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
In his first youth he was untrained,
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Heâ€™s blessed, who with his love combined
You see, by skies its predestined:
˜Of whom your own lyre sighs?â€™ By you Iâ€™m often briskly questioned, -
Heâ€™s always frowned, taciturn, Heâ€™s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
At last it stopped.
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
But Eugeneâ€™s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Allâ€™s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
˜What for you early disappeared?â€™
It now; but â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
But withered!
By habits of the life heâ€™s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
But how greatly Tanyaâ€™s altered!
Or not for long her heart was shattered
As if by greenish down covered.
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
He was afraid of being answered
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, heâ€™s admired;
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness whoâ€™s admired?
They donâ€™t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
˜And whom your lovely verse adored?â€™
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
Without them Onegmâ€™s pictured.
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
Some noise by beetleâ€™s raised.
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
All fashioned model of the creature Whoâ€™s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressedÂ».
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
BuyÃ¡nov courted: was refused.
At first his language me confused,
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
Malvinaâ€™s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
Or thatâ€™s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
Appoloâ€™s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
But something more us separated...
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poetâ€™s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
The shining skies are now blued.
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
All that I gladlessly survived.
But now doubts all are solved:
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
My father gave consent to wed.
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
His lifeâ€™s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
Decayed...
Her role how firmly played,
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
To meet the scholar worldâ€™s desire I could describe, youâ€™d be amazed.
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
˜Well, he is killedâ€™,- the neighbour said.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
And what for is can now lurid?
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
My poor Tanya sits, canâ€™t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
˜You see, Tatyanaâ€™s not a child,â€™ The old womanâ€™s voice is mild,-
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
Sad and cold,
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
˜Vladimir Lensky hereâ€™s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole worldâ€¦
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (Thatâ€™s all he knew in own world...)
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
To come to tables hand in hand.
Youâ€™ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
The teaâ€™s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
Sheâ€™s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foeâ€™s hand
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
His father didnâ€™t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
˜Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?â€™ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Meanwhile his eyes off her canâ€™t tear Some general important, grand.
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
That uhlanâ€™s loved by all her soulâ€¦ At altar now does she stand
Not grasping ways to understand
THE END
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
Indeed, for long should have the end!
I know, you were sent by goodness, Youâ€™ll be my guard until the end,
Heâ€™s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
Whatâ€™s the end?
Theyâ€™ve made me marry other man; And Iâ€™ll be true to him till end!
Sheâ€™s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesnâ€™t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
With PelagÃ©ya NikolÃ¡vna The sameâ€™s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
Is not it so, friend?
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you Iâ€™m staunch a friend.
With might and main heâ€™ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
To me true compass now lend
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
Iâ€™ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
Such subjectâ€™s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
Or dismal eye will never find
Could my Onegin now find.
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
To hostess a ladyâ€™s heading, Some plump grand generalâ€™s behind.
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
His soulâ€™s warmed with inspiration By ladyâ€™s greetings, friendly kind.
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
Sheâ€™s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugeneâ€™s kept in mind,
My poor mind...
˜You tell me, prince, if donâ€™t mind,
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
Forgotten features can remind.
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
Is really the secretâ€™s found?
The girls are jumping all around.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
The hall is full of crowd; The musicâ€™s weary of sound;
˜But how did you marry, nanny?â€™ -It was by wish of God.
Last evening frightful words Iâ€™d heard; Thank God!
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
Of Moscow young graces good
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
At the games of maidenhood.
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
But now - God! - is cooling blood
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
Each topicâ€™s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
Yet limpid is the near wood
He isnâ€™t moreâ€¦ The youngling bard
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
Forgive me, isnâ€™t it too hard?â€™ -For me itâ€™s not - â€˜But dear bard,
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Bewildered and astonished hard...
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
She looks, and all her own heart More oftenâ€™s heating and more hard.
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
To loose his colour heâ€™s beginning: She doesnâ€™t see or sheâ€™s too hard!?
But they would madden it too hard.
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
Has found end untimely hard!
For evening whist whoâ€™s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
And exclamations at the board:
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, Heâ€™s taking home dreadful hoard,
They say, theyâ€™d got For that the best in world reward.
™Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
She enters a deserted yard.
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
My dear early little bird!
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
˜Ah, my Lord!â€™,
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
Of course, he thinks, â€˜I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
The enmityâ€™s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
With goatâ€™s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
With time Iâ€™d smooth and then might be Iâ€™d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
But Iâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t bother me: To old times Iâ€™ll loyal be.
Dear! come to rueâ€¦ As in a dream it seems to be...
For long has chance with us to be?
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldnâ€™t be.
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future wonâ€™t be
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy browâ€™s languid peace.
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness Sheâ€™d catch oneâ€™s eyes by simple face.
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
But then a frenchman took her place.
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
Will show my renowned face And say: â€˜Itâ€™s poet of grace!â€™
The boy was frisky but with grace.
But well, sheâ€™s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sisterâ€™s pretty grace,
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maidenâ€™s choice,
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
Tatyanaâ€™s flushing, all sheâ€™s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
What joy: to-day weâ€™ll have to dance!
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
The colonel sent it for the chance.
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To ladyâ€™s album if by chance,
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
Tatyanaâ€™s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
But like a house all deserted Itâ€™s dark and still, and not by chance
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasnâ€™t smoothed by any chance:
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Meanwhile her soulâ€™s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
My Lenskyâ€™s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maidenâ€™s names by names from France,
None soulâ€™s seen in rooms at entrance...
Sheâ€™s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
They rush into the yard at once!
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
But soon for husband, all at once,
Itâ€™s mute for ever all at once.
Was asking Olya him at once
BuyÃ¡nov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutletâ€™s fat at once,
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student heâ€™s a dunce.
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
Away from Eugeneâ€™s lips; morose, Heâ€™s awkward, hardly has he force
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
He looks al her with tender ardour; Heâ€™s yet beloved with previous force,
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
Boom could fade.
But his such sufferable shade,
In winter, when the nightâ€™s weak shade
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
Allâ€™s blight, allâ€™s white without shade.
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
Perhaps, in Lethe wonâ€™t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
I canâ€™t foresee any objection To this representation made.
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
By winter carpets, snow-made.
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
In manâ€™s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
Heâ€™s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
For husband then she was yet bride.
Some real honour and the pride.
Was talking much of them with pride.
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
˜...canâ€™t sleep, itâ€™s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...â€™
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
˜You tell of those Your old times... Iâ€™ve boring tide..â€™
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, sheâ€™s free.
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
In tender manner they agree.
CHAPTER THREE
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
To fix her fate itâ€™s time, I see;
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
And by the peopleâ€™s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
Dianaâ€™s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
˜If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
˜Dâ€™you think.â€™ indeed... suspicions anyâ€¦ But do you see...
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
˜To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, Iâ€™ve ruined much of own life.
Whoâ€™s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
˜In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
With war; with magazineâ€™s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
˜But who is she?â€™ She is my wife,
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
At boring auntâ€™s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
With Tanya Lensky; KharlikÃ³va, The bride of more than ripening age,
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!â€™
At such a year, such an age.
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
And great belief in worldâ€™s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
Such time what can you do in village?
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
Of young delirium high rage.
As legends say of old age (For that weâ€™d praise in him the sage).
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
I donâ€™t grudge: why should I grudge?
- Princess, mon ange! -
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
He canâ€™t give happiness at largeâ€™.
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
Yes, It is he...
Whoâ€™s he?
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesnâ€™t move and doesnâ€™t breathe;
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
He couldnâ€™t be a bard for ever, He didnâ€™t go mad or die,
In brackets I would like to note: You havenâ€™t more insulting lie,
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have youâ€™d like, Or Eden to itselfâ€™s unlike.
- Dâ€™you joke -
Iâ€™m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
The field is dark in pretty gale...
Before arrival; anyhow She isnâ€™t bothered (thatâ€™s female!);
The autumn golden is coming, The natureâ€™s now trembling, pale
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
It is forgivable.
And give you all that 1 could scribble
˜But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?â€™
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Impossible!?
Arid, following Petrarkaâ€™s tracks, Could calm his heartâ€™s the biggest trouble.
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
Perhaps Iâ€™ll grieve if in a while
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
Of love mad sufferings sheâ€™s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
But after first cordial greeting Zaretskyâ€™s silent for a while
They argue louder; heâ€™s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
Meanwhile
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldnâ€™t tell meanwhile.
At Simeonâ€™s heâ€™s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
We must meanwhile
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
His epigramâ€™s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
I donâ€™t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui iâ€™morir non dole.
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
I donâ€™t mean to please grand people.
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
While he prefered to play a steed. His fingerâ€™s frozen a little,
We knew the game of passionâ€™s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
But road alarm of love then filled me.
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Forgive meâ€™.
With my request immodest, gladless Iâ€™d trouble you for helping me:
To play the cards was used with me.
˜But now tell;â€™ she says, â€˜to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?â€™
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
But are you listening yet to me?
Itâ€™s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
˜Well... I, my nannyâ€¦ donâ€™t know... For love Iâ€™m longing, dear me!
Oâ€™key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
Sheâ€™s after me.
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
By nothing bound, Iâ€™m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
Goodness me!
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
Child-Haroldâ€™s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
But Tanyaâ€™s heart yet isnâ€™t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..â€™
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
The loveâ€™s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
Such men (Iâ€™m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
They friends became.
Iâ€™m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her itâ€™s all the same.
To him she doesnâ€™t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
˜Well, no, just the same...
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
My friends, on bard youâ€™d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
˜Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
I ask: be patient for a time;
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
All services of old time.
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
˜Who might be thinking... all the time!
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
To have a rest and have a hike, Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll finish other time.
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
For long is weeping she this time.
And passed away of tears time?
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadnâ€™t time
Of course, of him Iâ€™ll quickly know,- For him I now havenâ€™t time.
You must remember that day time,
Is drawn, in turn Iâ€™ve bad nay time.
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
Next day has come...
It was well known friendly wellcome:
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
Â«FreischutzÂ» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
Ideal image, Tanyaâ€™s rhyme...
In brackets to the point Iâ€™d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
She sees: the room is light again, Through windowâ€™s a frosty pane
My dashing Eugene?
˜Hereâ€™s He! thatâ€™s Eugene!
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
That time, when in lyceumâ€™s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
˜Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
I could define
And even this my chapter five â€” From all digressions to refine.
Yet outside, as wellâ€™s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
My memory is dark.., Iâ€™m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
And where is her sister line?
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
And what can give me fate of mine?â€™
I write it, as for long my time I havenâ€™t any sin of mine.
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
To me that time you were quite right,â€™ To you is grateful soul mine...
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: â€˜Itâ€™s mine! Its mineâ€™
Alas, itâ€™s easy to divine!
™Heâ€™s ignoramusâ€™, said the neighbours, â€™He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
Of â€˜Clicquot widowâ€™ or â€˜Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
At Verreyâ€™s every morningâ€™s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
Pm sure... none, Theyâ€™ll be the family, the one.
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
Have less in difference between Each one.
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
-But no one...
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
CHAPTER ONE
From novelâ€™s only beginning â€” Iâ€™ve finished now chapter one.
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Well, I remember... has he gone?
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
You poets, are queer!â€™ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
While at the moon Tatyanaâ€™s looking, By own heart away sheâ€™s gone...
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altarâ€™s gone.
Unlucky victim, Lenskyâ€™s gone...
˜I donâ€™t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
In them he draws the country whole, The Kypridâ€™s temple, graves alone:
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
˜You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; thatâ€™s why at borne
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwatâ€™s octaves tune!
Replace the fortune.
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
˜Iâ€™ll perish, - says my Tanyaâ€™s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
Heâ€™s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! Heâ€™s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead youâ€™ll give a hope;
His Olgaâ€™s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
Youâ€™ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
The foes put the capes on steppe.
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
You didnâ€™t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
Canâ€™t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
What does next day for me prepare?
˜I see, in world youâ€™ve been too rare...
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
In vain I try to be aware,
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!â€™ - l could here
He thinks of here:
On leave the gussars hasten here
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
Like women, books were all left here,
He isnâ€™t here...
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education canâ€™t adhere
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didlaâ€™s crowned there.
And thereâ€¦ -
My goddessesâ€™ what are you? where?
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
To judgings by the world severe
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
Iâ€™d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
But what severe!
The fisherâ€™s fire.
Yet being child, in childrenâ€™s throng To play and jump had none desire,
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
Italian nights I shall adore.
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Yes, I shall come, Iâ€™ll come!â€™ - before
The shepherdâ€™s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
Much more... -
And in the solitude severe Her passionâ€™s heating yet much more,
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
IvÃ¡n PetrÃ³vichâ€™s fool and bore, SemyÃ³n PetrÃ³vich stints yet more;
Sheâ€™s running - he is after her; She canâ€™t be running any more,
The tears of the peopleâ€™s awe. Katenin there could restore
Malfilatre.
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards theyâ€™ll not endure
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we canâ€™t endure,
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
Itâ€™s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
And she, that young and lovely creature;
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Expresses death but not the torture.
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!â€™
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
Mazurka is the crowdâ€™s choice; All round are crush and noise;
Heâ€™s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
What purpose?
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
The morning pleasant noise arose.
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what dâ€™you think? again collapse!â€™
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
Heâ€™ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
He canâ€™t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
But well, its time I should be busy: The beautyâ€™s letter I should use.
Whatâ€™s use?
I live and write not for applause,
To PetushkÃ³v she never goes; PykhtÃ­n, the hussar, toed to fuse
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
He doesnâ€™t gather them with horn. A maidenâ€™s singing in her house,
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
And with Oneginâ€™s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
Indeed, dâ€™you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
In life with us like new itâ€™s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
The heart of somebody heâ€™ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
I canâ€™t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
But my fate
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
At KharitÃ³nyaâ€™s in the alley In front of house at the gate
Itâ€™s late.
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
I have without any doubts Tatyanaâ€™s letter to translate.
˜Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
As pawn thatâ€™s worth of dear mate.
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
With love friendsâ€™ notions Iâ€™d rate
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soulâ€™s rate
Upstairs to the highest rate.
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
The capitalâ€™s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, Iâ€™d like to write,
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
Be glad with such a manâ€¦ You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
And unattentive smart lornette.
Alas, Tatyanaâ€™s daily fading: Sheâ€™s paling, sinking and is mute,
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
She courtedâ€¦ at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letterâ€™s trembling on her palm, The waferâ€™s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heavenâ€™s blue
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
By new one canâ€™t I be admired I pity old one - itâ€™s true.
˜Indeed? - my Eugeneâ€™s now thinking, - But is it true?..
And that... but afterwards youâ€™ll know, Is not it true?
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
Marmontelâ€™s volume them he gave.
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame Youâ€™d guess, as I would well behave
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
And much the more itâ€™s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
My dear God, you bless and save!
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Heâ€™s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
What for to grieve?
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
CHAPTER FIVE
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
A mere hit from all Iâ€™d give.
Do comme il fautâ€¦ (Shishkov, forgive; canâ€™t some good translation give).
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
Forgive!
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
And wondered: would he be alive?â€™
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
Whichâ€™s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
For what and where do I strive?
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
You help my doubts to resolve:
But canâ€™t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
On earth, then might be by her love Sheâ€™d joined the friends the day above!
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
Ah, he could love; they donâ€™t now Have anything like real love
Of poet, whoâ€™s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
And Iâ€™ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
Fille Ã©tait fille, elle Ã©tait amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
But whom to love?
Or otherwise Iâ€™d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
If you could know, whatâ€™s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
Of humble girl some secret love?
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, Iâ€™m husband yours by love!"
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
I dread: in my submissive prayers Youâ€™ll see by strict, severe gaze
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw oneâ€™s gaze,
His misty, foggy gaze
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
His ardent talk was full of haze;
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soulâ€™s haze.
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendshipâ€™s heavy haze?
Like Harold Child Oneginâ€™s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
ZarÃ©tsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
To comfort sorrow and grief.
And you, â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
And quickly both they yet off
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
And then he dressed himself...
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Whose author bolter natureâ€™s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
Oneginâ€™s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
Alone with his soulâ€™s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
Whoâ€™s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
But heâ€™s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
Letâ€™s visit them; youâ€™ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maidenâ€™s album big,
˜But who? plump general that big?â€™
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Who left TambÃ³v without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
Itâ€™s both harmful and absorbing.
Sincerely, in grief embracing
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again heâ€™s dancing.
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end lifeâ€™s novel reading,
At first of them she didnâ€™t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
Aloneâ€™s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
The fire-place is fading...
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isnâ€™t fading,
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
At fire-place the tableâ€™s lain: Oneginâ€™s waiting - Lenskyâ€™s speeding
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
Imagine: Iâ€™m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
He trembles... to princess heâ€™s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
You came two times, but then of self You donâ€™t make them yet reminding
Mazurkaâ€™s sounding.
He didnâ€™t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children youâ€™d be seeing
If sheâ€™s seeing
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isnâ€™t seeing;
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
What roses, you can be judging,
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend Iâ€™m now singing,
Just He! His gaze on her heâ€™s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her heâ€™s reaching,
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
To protests of soulâ€™s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
He looks, he calls him - allâ€™s for nothing!
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
In horror Tanya is awaking...
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goetheâ€™s, Shinerâ€™s places hiking,
The clockâ€™s been striking
With dangerous book aloneâ€™s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
That was the way of Eugeneâ€™s thinking.
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
And who, dâ€™you think, from it is looking?
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields sheâ€™s now looking:
But then with books she could be dealing.
˜Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, Iâ€™m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Oneginâ€™ -Well done dealing.
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hareâ€™s trembling
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
Tatyanaâ€™s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this worldâ€™s fuss sheâ€™s hatred feeling.
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
Oneginâ€™s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
- All they are yet feeling
Oneginâ€™s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
Iâ€™ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you Iâ€™m dangling:
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on tableâ€™s falling
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In fear I was crying, darling,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughterâ€™s bed till day was dreaming
About what sheâ€™s now dreaming?
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
Too long the silenceâ€™s now seeming...
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
To make your dear magic tuning Of beautyâ€™s passion mood, resuming
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
His nets for them were so frightening!
Or where Thaliaâ€™s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isnâ€™t listening;
That recently I was you christening?â€™
You donâ€™t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
He shouts: â€˜Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
All barking, dogs to her are running.
A brave sledge-cart from fieldâ€™s returning, Itâ€™s fluffy furrows upturning,
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
And whatâ€™s Onegin doing?
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence nowâ€™s keeping.
Dâ€™you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?â€™
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while heâ€™s sleeping,
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful sheâ€™s shyly stepping
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasnâ€™t grasping.
He hurries up to ring.
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
For fair of the brides her bring,
They say, you are a lone guy, In countryâ€™s stillness you are boring.
Iâ€¦â€™ -But you are boring
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
An Laneâ€™s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
Letâ€™s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I canâ€™t be appraising,
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
Nor makes get up without choosing.
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, itâ€™s quite distressing
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
But Hymenâ€™s troubles, griefs of mating,
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
Invitations for a meeting?
What was the sequence of the meeting?
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
By clear smile the natureâ€™s fitting Through dream the yearâ€™s morning meeting
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Ran up and not without fighting
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
Already for triumph heâ€™s waiting,
To Talonâ€™s surely heâ€™s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
For his delight were just awaiting.
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
Thatâ€™s why in French sheâ€™s always writing.
A passionate epistleâ€™s writing.
I prize my hours, my days: But Iâ€™m in idle boredom wasting
And then at prince she was adjusting
Whom youâ€™d be trusting?
At last sheâ€™s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But letâ€™s return to lady sitting.
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
Regards of them to you Iâ€™m giving.
˜And I was gingebread you giving!â€™
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
All yet living
And now North, all clouds driving,
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
The snow-drift at once is moving...
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtainâ€™s moving
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
I write, and heart yet isnâ€™t boring, The pen unwitting isnâ€™t drawing
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
˜There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!â€™
To guess the windy youth is trying
A ladyâ€™s love until to-day To speak her Russian isnâ€™t trying,
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
For flying glory donâ€™t long.
For how long?
The evening darkness comes along...
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of men, whom I canâ€™t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
The masterâ€™s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
Or really she guessed not wrong?
Maidenâ€™s Song
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
Each minute more is captivated By Olgaâ€™s beauty so young,
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
˜Ah, Eugene!â€™, - She is quickly running, Like shade sheâ€™s prompt, to exitâ€™s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back itâ€™s hard; In short a minute sheâ€™s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
Itâ€™s striking ten; heâ€™s driving out. Heâ€™s flying... now heâ€™s at porch.
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
At neighbourâ€™s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
In hands I have Tatyanaâ€™s letter. Itâ€™s kept by me with sacred sigh.
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
But Latinâ€™s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
Could me enjoy... Iâ€™ve had my fill; It is enough!
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
The coachmanâ€™s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
Who carefully us can cherish?
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
As object of the judging noisy, In life youâ€™d never have a wish:
Youâ€™ll see: they all become the bosh
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she canâ€™t have breath..
Heâ€™s trembling, loses fitting words, Heâ€™s happy, has improved his health,
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
And so grew they old both.
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Alone to my nurse, whoâ€™s being My old friend from youth and forth.
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, Weâ€™ll call him dandy for the forth.
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
In own dreams allâ€™s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?

Let me look back.
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistolâ€™s cock.
The pistols all are now shining, The hammerâ€™s jingling at the lock,
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madmanâ€™s hearty mock.
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olgaâ€™s frock.
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
My Eugeneâ€™s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
˜But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
To walk?
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
Her husbandâ€™s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
Of multiplied his own crank.
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novelâ€™s crank.
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
She doesnâ€™t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
His morbid and quite dying look,
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
˜Left side?.. but where? what is there?â€™ I â€˜It doesnâ€™t matter, but you look,
The hamlet, where Eugeneâ€™s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
As at the reason of the parting Tatyanaâ€™s grumbling at the brook,
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for riverâ€™s crook.
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
The evening skyâ€™s more dark.
Its dark.
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shillerâ€™s work.
You now bless long yearsâ€™ work

But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
Well have the music regimental!
He came, What news, such sentimental!
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Sometimes sheâ€™s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola Iâ€™ll travel
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
By nightâ€™s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
He doesnâ€™t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
While sheâ€™s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
Like victim under charming veil.
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
But send your boy, and first of allâ€™ .
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
About Lenskyâ€™s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winterâ€™s bliss and tinges all:
For theatre Oneginâ€™s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
To tell you all, what he had known, I havenâ€™t any time at all.
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didnâ€™t talk at all,
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasnâ€™t right at all
But you are pale... What are you feeling? â€˜Itâ€™s nothing, nanny, not at all.
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
But suddenly was changed it all:
At the beginning of my novel â€” (In chapter first you look it all)
The first he made - he left you all;
Healthy all...
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
Iâ€™d like to use the Albanâ€™s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
Itâ€™s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
You listen to my grievous call:
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journalâ€™s call:
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at riverâ€™s banks they fall.
Itâ€™s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Importantly repeats for doll The motherâ€™s lessons, though small.
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horsesâ€™ stallâ€¦â€™
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
Is flying from the waxy cell.
Iâ€™m sorry that you goâ€¦ well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
Behind the mill.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it heâ€™s flying to the mill;
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
The waters Are still.
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, sheâ€™s standing still.
You alone Among anxieties in still
It all is still.
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forestâ€™s still
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the countryâ€™s still!
As I to loose my freedom feared Whichâ€™s hateful to my own will.
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didnâ€™t play with doll;
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pullâ€¦
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
˜But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?â€™
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
Opinion of the public mournful!
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
To you Iâ€™m greatful!
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
˜Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
With clear soul
The doubts all confused her soul:
A bowl

XL
XL
XL
XL

XXXIX, XL
Thatâ€™s what I am.
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
And where everythingâ€™s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
I saw myself in cherished dream
And slowly through fields sheâ€™s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
But Tanya now like in dream
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soulâ€™s quiet dream.
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Nevaâ€™s stream,
But now radiant moonâ€™s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
I â€” It sparkles by Hippocreneâ€™s role, It was by own play and foam
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
With reason I remembered them.
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lilyâ€™s stem
Princess, undone yet before him
Through tears never seeing him,
Sometimes, when heâ€™s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
My God! what thoughts could come to him!â€™
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didnâ€™t come at all to him
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
Alter him
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!â€™
Three houses will wait for him.
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
Princess is staring at him...
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
From bed Onegin wasnâ€™t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
Heâ€™s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, heâ€™s being in a whim.
What a whim...
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
As sign of friendshipâ€™s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
Whatâ€™s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet sheâ€™s looking rather slim;
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
Rousseau (Iâ€™d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
The Gulnareâ€™s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
A hundred times is blessed, whoâ€™s faithful. Whoâ€™s got his wit to be quite calm,
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
The snowâ€™s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
In countryâ€™s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
But will it come, my day of freedom?
The same I was in time of wisdom,
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfastâ€™s ready in the room.
And here is the banns room.
Reminiscence of old time, Of maidenâ€™s room!
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
To whom my vice is not a harm?
And Iâ€™m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
Who never bores us by his charm?
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
As quick as can
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
Of bold childrenâ€™s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
In them Iâ€™ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
-itâ€™s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
Is spoiled by old duels fan, Heâ€™s evil, gossip, talking man...
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
A simple maiden
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Enough... and has been done the burden:
What for yet here has he been?
Where we have never been.
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Well, I saluted classicism! Itâ€™s late, but preface has been seen.
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
- Not, then!
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
To them He paid his all attention then.
Ah, many friends were near then!
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
The head of Chaldean wise men, â€” Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
Has fallenâ€¦
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
And whispered her each one of them: â€˜You look left side at those menâ€¦â€™
With Lea, thatâ€™s given him too sweety; With ladiesâ€™ flatness; tunes of men;
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
You write the odes, gentlemen,
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
˜Whith Olga what could happen?
Unwittingly in mirrorâ€™s peeping Ashamed to recognize: heâ€™s beaten;
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
CHAPTER SEVEN
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
-Letâ€™s go.- They were quietly driven,
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
Came in.
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
And then I thought: Heâ€™s now in;
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
By Olgaâ€™s hand the teaâ€™s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyanaâ€™s standing, Sheâ€™s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted windowâ€™s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
I dread to read again...
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquetâ€™s cracks wee heard again.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet sheâ€™s sighing once again
In letters though he again
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
Unmoving, lone heâ€™s again.
Alas! I must repeat again:
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
Because sheâ€™s innocent and plain,
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
Have been decayed in natureâ€™s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
It in strain
A menu hangs for orderâ€™s sake And teases appetite in vain.
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
At brook the monument is seeing Sheâ€™s drawing made of leather rein,
Onegin.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
Tatyanaâ€™s letter to Onegin.
Whatâ€™s my Onegin?
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
Presents his friend and distant kin.
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun heâ€™s looking on...
Meanwhile heâ€™s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar heâ€™s having on	{3]
Go on!
If their district visits on?
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
Heâ€™s now languished by remorse, Heâ€™s being ready to beg pardon,
What is your name? - Heâ€™s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphonâ€¦
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
He didnâ€™t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
Oneginâ€™s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
I can foresee: youâ€™ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
My Moscow... in this lunation
For you the glory and the laud, The fatherâ€™s land, incarceration?
To touch in splendid admiration.
Whereâ€™s agitation And honourable aspiration
Great charm to any conversation.
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
For thoughtful singing with attention?â€™
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
At first theyâ€™d nothing seen In common.
Like in van Dickâ€™s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, sheâ€™s boon
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
Like thoughts of simple ladyâ€™s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
Byron
And whatâ€™s the reason?
If by the family best vision For instant Iâ€™d be charmed with reason,-
That instant I could trunk with reason
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
But hero, Iâ€™m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!â€™
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
He, might be, for the worldâ€™s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
On tableâ€™s hissing yet, forlorn...
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
Iâ€™ll take a look and then turnâ€™,
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
And am I soon at thirties turn?
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
˜Shall go forth or should return?..
And is it true, it canâ€™t return?
And didnâ€™t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
By bondage Lenskyâ€™s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Oneginâ€™s eyes make tire own,
She doesnâ€™t say: â€˜Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
All right, by hand unfair own
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
Did try to make of that some fun: The countryâ€™s freedom has its own
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirrorâ€™s aiming down,
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
For centures to make him known.
Iâ€™m unknown...
And Iâ€™m in family unknown...
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
But it is late, itâ€™s time to go...
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
On steps of world the bard might go
To be with you I cannot go...
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
I was his friend some while ago.
˜Noâ€™.
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
CHAPTER TWO
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
With him my cousin first BuyÃ¡nov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
In them you canâ€™t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
Heâ€™s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
She runs for forest... heâ€™s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
A need for sleep.
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
Not a word can slip
She doesnâ€™t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isnâ€™t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
I stop!
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
All that I donâ€™t grasp.
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
is going, and when sheâ€™s trying To turn aside... is coming up
But dangerous for the maidenâ€™s heart) Quite reddenning heâ€™s missing up.
At usual hour stirred up, In candleâ€™s light sheâ€™s getting up.
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
Iâ€™ve read it up:
Heâ€™s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
To other things letâ€™s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
But other times in mind I bear!
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
Heâ€™s not been seen, none word from dear;
My poets! Iâ€™d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
I didnâ€™t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
Of Russian Terpsichoreâ€™s dear
And Olgaâ€™s yawning; round here Sheâ€™s looking for her Lensky dear.
Enough, my dear...
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!â€™â€¦ -To whom, my dear?
That heâ€™s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
Youâ€™ll fall in love once more and findâ€¦ You learn to rule yourself: I fear
But then your horse will try in fear
All flows in a single gear...
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
He slept and coffee had he here, His menagerâ€™s reports could hear,
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
Allâ€™s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Goodness me, it isnâ€™t For him to hear!
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshkyâ€™s sounds hear),
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Dâ€™you hear?
Tanya, near!
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
You give a pen and paper, dear, Iâ€™ll stay in bed; make table near;
˜And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
Dâ€™you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
In early spring of every year.
˜But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
Itâ€™s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
Like Julieâ€™s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
And when a falling shining star
-What said the satirist, remember!
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesnâ€™t slumber,
The same is dog, the sameâ€™s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
˜Iâ€™ll be defender; Iâ€™ll not endure when offender
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
Is cunning liric, who can render
Such charming, tender.
His look was always quick and tender,
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
Sheâ€™s not astonished, hasnâ€™t anger...
What blunder! Iâ€™m a punished ranger.
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
˜Of them my Olga is the younger.
And. told her:
For tears, rhymes and so on?â€¦ Present me herâ€™.
But itâ€™s enough to speak of her:
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
And when sometimes in front of her
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
˜Lord! to her!..
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
The wish of heart to whisper her.
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runsâ€¦ the bearâ€™s after her!
To answer her.
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
˜Tanya though!â€™ â€˜Dâ€™you know her?-
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
Itâ€™s time, its time to marry her!
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
Tatyana hadnâ€™t any trends To play with them in any weather:
˜What slow-witted you are, nyanya!â€™ -Iâ€™m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barinâ€™s will Iâ€™d ratherâ€¦-
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
Some other...
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
˜But Iâ€™d prefer another,
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian â€œÐ½â€ in French best manner
With blood sustained each pure hand... Theyâ€™d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
You now come to rooms, the inner...
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
All have the supper.
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
What shall I do, I canâ€™t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
Well dressed, sheâ€™s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Every country eater
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
And you forgive, my freedom later!
But let me help with sacred water.
You are in heat.- - But Iâ€™m not ill Well... nanny, Iâ€™m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
My God, a scene from novels dear...â€™ -And thatâ€™s my daughter...
With her heâ€™s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
Itâ€™s winter!..
˜Well, dear me, what is the matter?
Itâ€™s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Where is it better?
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
All they utter
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
Prepare ruins once for ever...
Her tender fingers didnâ€™t dare To take a needle; she could never
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
If not... if not, let God deliver!
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
But no answer...
Sheâ€™s up at once, Like shade sheâ€™s pale, but no answer...
The day had gone, but no answer...
Without answer.
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
But She whom I yet donâ€™t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
Oneginâ€™s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
Hor
He opened a door."
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Oneginâ€™s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
CHAPTER FOUR
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journalâ€™s clamour
Letâ€™s go, do thorn such a favour!
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
At sister Tanya isnâ€™t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girlâ€™s small feet and no heads.
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
But where now through them speeds
But sheâ€™s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
Some loss in all the songâ€™s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
Sheâ€™s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
Sheâ€™s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
Its here: take it and be â€˜tacklingâ€™ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
I was taking you in hands!
˜And I your ears pulled by hands!â€™
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
Who isnâ€™t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanyaâ€™s shoulder he bends;
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw heâ€™s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
Sheâ€™s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
I had happened To know many old legends,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
All poets, meanwhile Iâ€™ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
Ruslanâ€™s, Lyudmilaâ€™s friends!
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
Among admirers obedient Iâ€™ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
The heavenâ€™s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Who fatherâ€™s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Heâ€™ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
Let give the God his soul chances
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
But thatâ€™s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
At gooseâ€™s neck a skull is fateful, Itâ€™s whirling round for all sides;
But now, friends, from all my sides -
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
The prince as if anew him sees:
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
Four fatal for the life the stages...
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
From glass not stopping For a whileâ€™. He never kisses hands of ladies,
Of higher world the queer ladies!
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
The snowâ€™s crackling... someoneâ€™s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
Of yard boys family just flies.
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
At her much frightened loud cries
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his motherâ€™s finger shakes.
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once oneâ€™s feelings strikes.
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With age to argue is unfitness; The customâ€™s despot of the males.
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
-In this I see yet no troublesâ€¦
Of daily troubles.
Is it because in higher circles
Ali that has gone like soundâ€™s fizz, And dear Tanyaâ€™s youth all dwindles:
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
Tatyana trusted legendâ€™s fancies Of simple folkâ€™s old times.
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
˜Bordeauxâ€™ all the times!
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
I know: Parnyâ€™s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Her husband comes.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: â€˜Ah!â€™ But he becomes
You take my set of florid rhymes
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
At other kinds of lines.
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
The foes!
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
Why not? Itâ€™s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
He cast a glance at ladiesâ€™ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
˜But trouble is: they are such boresâ€™.
But canâ€™t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hadesâ€™ spectres
She doesnâ€™t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
Do not reflect Dianaâ€™s features, Recalling bygone novelâ€™s creatures,
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
His pistol then Onegin raises
La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
Indeed, by magnetismâ€™s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
Zhizhi, my soulâ€™s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
Oneginâ€™s coining with excuses.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
The vice, thatâ€™s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
The first of leaflets just can show: Quâ€™ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
Or arenâ€™t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Some several miles from KrasnogÃ³ry, From Lenskyâ€™s village, there lives
Alas! On furrows of lives
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
Iâ€™d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kantâ€™s ideas and his moves.
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
Grand treatyâ€™s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
Of course, Oneginâ€™s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
But shall I see you?â€™ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
But in gloomy cliffs
Sheâ€™s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
Of known ladies feet and legs.
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
To take it up she canâ€™t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novelâ€™s beings,
To Moscow, they need good things.â€™..,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine Iâ€™ve shooting things.
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
Of agitated soulâ€™s feelings
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
She falls on snow - he is swifty: Heâ€™s taking her in paws and brings,
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles bringsâ€™
Onegin got Tatyanaâ€™s message. It quickly touched his soulâ€™s strings:
A shepherd bast gay sandalâ€™s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
My greetings!
That dream aroused her misgivings.
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
By got by Olga strange tuition Sheâ€™s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
Decided is.
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
Which doesnâ€™t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Heâ€™s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
Whoâ€™s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?â€™,
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
In all of them restrictionâ€™s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mindâ€™s the secret backs.
The novelty with ages smacks.
But by your narrow small tracks,
Of tears tracks?..
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forestâ€™s thicks?
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricksâ€¦
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-riverâ€™s banks.
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
May be, you saw at Nevaâ€™s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
The talkative my lyreâ€™s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
She thinks:
Some tears shed at urn my early: â€˜He tell in love with me,â€™ to thinks
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
In sledge heâ€™s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
His own works?
Zaretskyâ€™s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
My muse new person just reveals.
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
With one of feet the floor sheâ€™s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
And boring picturesâ€™ row, done In style of La Fontaineâ€™s sweet novels.
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: Whatâ€™s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
Of legislator of the halls?
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga PetushkÃ³v then whirls,
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
That time to all my childish dreams
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
Indeed, heâ€™s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maidenâ€™s dreams.
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
At window alone, sad (Dianaâ€™s ray lights up, her wakens)
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
˜Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
At margins of the books sheâ€™s meeting Of readerâ€™s pencil slightest signs:
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each otherâ€™s brains;
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
To have remorse I havenâ€™t forces; Like Bogdanovichâ€™s all verses Iâ€™d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
In young sad soulâ€™s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
Weâ€™ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of mind some cold observations,
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
He hasnâ€™t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The follyâ€™s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
And he inspired her at dawns!
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
Each claps.
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Her maidenâ€™s mirror yet she keeps.
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Tatyana steeps.
Of looking back she doesnâ€™t dare And hurries up, sheâ€™s quickening steps,
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armidâ€™s pretty lips,
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
˜Well, let us goâ€¦â€™ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyanaâ€™s husband just appears,
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
In crowd everybody renders:
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
˜To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?â€™
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Brothers!
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
At any sides weâ€™ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
My Tanyaâ€™s hugged by their daughters.
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
Like North Auroraâ€™s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
Zaretsky to behave refuses: â€˜But where is the second yours?â€™
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
Says yes or no, never Ð´Ð°-Ñ Or Ð½ÐµÑ‚-Ñâ€™(the words, they all would pass).
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
She doesnâ€™t glare at the rest, And doesnâ€™t claim to have success;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
To meet princess.
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but donâ€™t we. confess.
Was too afraid, I must confess...
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
˜For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or itâ€™s impossible or faithless
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you Iâ€™d never know, thus I wouldnâ€™t know tortures sleepless.
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
With age the life is such a badness...â€™
I like teenageâ€™s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret tormentâ€™s gladness...
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
˜Sed alia temporalâ€™ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
His lunch him answered with politeness.
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
He liked the groveâ€™s timid thickness,
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizonâ€™s foolish brightnessâ€™.
In actions husbandâ€™s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
And no brow moved she rasher; She didnâ€™t even lips her press.
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But itâ€™s a stress
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
But with Tatyana shanâ€™t we guess.
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
˜Iâ€™m not quite made to be much happy. My soulâ€™s alien for bliss;
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them Iâ€™m not yet worthy, miss.
In duels classic, pedant cross
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
But doesnâ€™t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In country tediumâ€™s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
Why! out of the country thickets...â€™
In deserts of the heavenâ€™s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
By sorcery of storyâ€™s secrets!
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
But where are you? Come! My rights
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
At window she now sits.
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
Iâ€™m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
By him were left at your employments.
Whom donâ€™t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladiesâ€™ hearts.
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
But landlords of the countryâ€™s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
And he invents by whimâ€™s requests Caricatures of the guests.
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
-Iâ€™m glad. - â€˜but when?â€™ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
But even such a friendship, readers, We havenâ€™t now; each of us
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier sheâ€™s liking us,
What for you visited all us?
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
And let them God long live for us!
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
We them remind about us...
His verse is sluggish and obscure (Itâ€™s called romanticism by us;
With dear muse of mine capricious Letâ€™s hear forestâ€™s noise delicious
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests itâ€™s always zealous,
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Alone you, to speak my mind, Iâ€™d take as friend of days my grievous,
And Tatyanaâ€™s nervous
O , rus!
The seasons country views
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
Meanwhile Oneginâ€™s stay at Larinâ€™s Was estimated like a news,
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Some cold wind just blows.
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
™But may be sheâ€™s in love?â€™ â€˜Who knows?
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
Youâ€™ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
˜At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
Will take the twilight of my days.
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: â€˜Iâ€™ve my happy days...â€™
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
Without fail youâ€™ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torchâ€™s rays;
Whoâ€™s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Whoâ€™s that, which never us betrays?
The woman says:
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself Iâ€™ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
Canâ€™t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
The withering of own days, Which canâ€™t revive by any ways?
Itâ€™s dark in valleys.
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaidâ€™s.
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maidenâ€™s.
˜And whom?â€™ - Sheâ€™s Larinâ€™s. -
A dwarf with tail; and thereâ€™s that Whoâ€™s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drumsâ€™s beat.
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
She hurries up to have a chat.
In dark my Tanyaâ€™s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
But why? I donâ€™t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
Then he for her a chairâ€™s finding, They speak about this and that,
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
For all of that
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
As they are mean and simple features, You wonâ€™t see fine art in that.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
What?
And what.
And what?
And what?
And what?
And what? -
˜But do you love, indeed, the other?â€™ -And what? -
Sheâ€™s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
But never wanted to correct; To censorship Iâ€™ll pay my debt;
But may be those kinds of pictures By now canâ€™t you all attract,
His letterâ€™s here, quite exact.
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
With yawn Iâ€™ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
He differed people in effect, And otherâ€™s passions could respect.
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
But I can hardly drag my feet,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
For garden now we shall fleet In which sheâ€™s got with him to meet.
With kin to meet
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
But many days away could get
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Of own life he could forget!
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
˜I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
Of stylish words some ready set?
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
˜You now meet...â€™ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
- Yes and no yet.
But summerâ€™s flying quicker yet.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
Is he a parody not yet?
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
Because ire, truthfulness sheâ€™s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
CHAPTER EIGHT
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinterâ€™s crackling making light.
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heavenâ€™s bodies light
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forgeâ€™s light
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Shall see emotional flight?
Should I begin my freedom flight.
And fair sex like downâ€™s slight...
Opinions of the worldly might...
In languish of the loving bounds Heâ€™s spending now day and night.
And often at Tauridaâ€™s beaches She brought me in the have of night
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
Of balletâ€™s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
And often in the summerâ€™s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
I donâ€™t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Itâ€™s right.
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasnâ€™t right.
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
They donâ€™t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
Itâ€™s time to leave for life the tight
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, whoâ€™s lost in thought,
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
For her heâ€™s looking on... for nought...
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
They all replaced for each of roberts; The teaâ€™s been brought.
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Oneginâ€™s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
-But what is it -
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
˜Itâ€™s seven soon, itâ€™s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to waitâ€™.
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
™My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
He stepped away... he turned a bit..â€™-
And proud languageâ€™s now lit For prose postal a bit.
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
˜My dreams and years wonâ€™t rather Return to make me new a bit,
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
˜My habit,..
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
The letterâ€™s ready, has been fit...
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
In front of him gay fancyâ€™s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
Itâ€™s better place for passing letters fit.
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, Youâ€™ll never leave me such unfit.
I was embittered, heâ€¦ unfit.
IstÃ³minaâ€™s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
My studentâ€™s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
A yard boyâ€™s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
Together for a time they sit.
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
With KharlikÃ³v PanfÃ­l and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
And by degrees to sleep heâ€™s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
And now jealouserâ€™s triumphant!
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didnâ€™t want:
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didnâ€™t want
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l donâ€™t want;
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages donâ€™t want.
What more you want?
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
By dreadful exclamation Oneginâ€™s shuddered; slain, impatient
Are silent.
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
What will he choose for his engagement?
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
Some balls, one childrenâ€™s entertainment...
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in loveâ€™s adjustment
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
The inns are absent.
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didnâ€™t join the guild existent
Haphazard wander to prevent.
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larinâ€™s soon forever went:
They joked, not without sin At Tanyaâ€™s suitor made a hint.
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relationâ€™s lint, -
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
And stands at stint
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyanaâ€™s heart was burnt!
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
The mistress cries, â€˜At last youâ€™ve got!â€™
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
But uncoordinated volumes From devilâ€™s library all got,
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
Lornette his captious he has got,
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
Is it high time as I forgot
˜And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.â€™.
The youthful years would be fading, The soulâ€™s heat would not be hot
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
It might he other: heâ€™d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young loverâ€™s lot:
Not...
Andâ€¦ he could not.
˜Do not.â€™
Is it not
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
They didnâ€™t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
Sheâ€™s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldnâ€™t give a hoot..
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
Itâ€™s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
Became alredy quite inapt.
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
Of grievous notes of the heart.
About otherâ€™s restless passions, And otherâ€™s love will touch the heart, -
Indeed, you wonâ€™t With all your pure flaming heart
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tamaâ€™s heart.
Itâ€™s all decided (itâ€™s my version) By heavens board: Iâ€™m yours at heart.
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
But to no person In all the world Iâ€™d give my heart,
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
For nowhere am I smart...
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
With which to start?
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..â€™
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
But at least
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
I havenâ€™t force... is tired breastâ€¦
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
Of what a languorâ€™s full her breast?
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
˜Itâ€™s mine!â€™ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
And how long?â€™ â€˜Two will he fast...â€™
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!â€™
The spring of honour, idol last!
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
Heâ€™s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
To scratch unfaithful icy path As heâ€™s afraid to fall at last.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
To inner porch he goes fast, Heâ€™s laying down her at last.
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
With own wife thatâ€™s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
And stilly does she say at last:
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
I liked his features in the past:
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures wonâ€™t be the best.
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
˜My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
For love sheâ€™s dedicated truly Like loyal child for motherâ€™s nest,
Letâ€™s come together... take a rest...
New way Iâ€™m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
With heavenly her pride sheâ€™s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
The â€˜elseâ€™s trendsâ€™, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid letâ€™s have dinner before rest!
Monsieur lâ€™Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
In talks allâ€™s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
He made me love him with insistence And couldnâ€™t find some better test.
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
The beds are made. And any guest
But hist!
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
Not Eugene heâ€™s at most?
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isnâ€™t frozen by frost.
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
˜Iâ€™m neighbour justâ€™.
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
˜Enough, get up, I now must
The fireâ€™s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coalâ€™s crust;
Was shaking. Due to Zues heâ€™s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Deserted room alone filling You read; itâ€™s Pradt, itâ€™s Walter Scott.
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
In bookâ€™s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
-But what about?
But yet she canâ€™t.
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I canâ€™t...
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0

Again promiscuosly heâ€™s readingâ€¦ Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
Believe, Iâ€™d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
If I were poet like you.
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarkaâ€™s language â€˜I love youâ€™ .
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, Iâ€™d like with you
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used Iâ€™d run from you;
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
But what Iâ€™d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
To you Iâ€™ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
˜For single winter it will do, At least Iâ€™ll credit money youâ€™â€¦

Allâ€™s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy PustyakÃ³v
With own heavy hall, his dear; GvozdÃ­n, BuyÃ¡nov, PetushkÃ³v
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy PetushkÃ³v,
I love him, heâ€™s my kin in-law.
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
Lensky saw
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
Of life her features have but few.
And me you have in view...
What for would ever view
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Among the friends the moonâ€™s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
Iâ€™ve heard some voice of new desire, Iâ€™ve got new sorrow anew;
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
Effects, but stepped away anew; Heâ€™s blessed much more, who never knew
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
And with a bow
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
How would you not love Moscow?
To-morrow weâ€™ll Tanya show...
For changes fated anyhow...
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
Sheâ€™s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
What kindâ€™s he now anyhow?
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
Of lively lucid verseâ€™s glow,
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
Is he the same or quiet now?
But now...
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
˜What, you are married! didnâ€™t know!
Dâ€™you know?...
This kind of book yet doesnâ€™t show The writerâ€™s fancies in a row,
Two pistols in a row,
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,

We havenâ€™t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
And in a day
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
Youâ€™d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
When heâ€™s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
And gradually rises day.
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
Sheâ€™s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
˜Me?â€™ - Yes, Tatyanaâ€™s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
And drifting of the countryâ€™s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
On riverâ€™s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
Sheâ€™s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
The further Iâ€™m from youth my gay,
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
˜I fell in loveâ€™, again she whispers In nurseâ€™s ear in dismay.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
And. so cunny, she is gay. Alreadyâ€™s able to betray!
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
What do you want to ask, you say!
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
At him she stares all the way:
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
Then weâ€™ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
Moldavia, thatâ€™s far away From Italy, was end of way.
From mountains descends this way
˜What way?
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winterâ€™s even every way.
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
Her tired look and slipped away...
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
Her head to shoulderâ€™s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
Sheâ€™s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
And she, as if sheâ€™s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
˜Whatâ€™s happened?â€™- `Nothingâ€™â€¦ - Gets away.
To call some people gets away.
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
˜I fell in love... youâ€™d get away
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
She went away.
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
And all grandparents exclaim: â€™But how years fly away!â€™
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
You get along the Nevaâ€™s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
Oneginâ€™s quick to dress. Already His sernantâ€™s ordered to be ready
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse alreadyâ€™s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, itâ€™s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
I see you strong already!
To cry, to weep Iâ€™m now ready...â€™ -I see, you are unwell already
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
Has come; to servant says he will Lepageâ€™s fatal barrels steady
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
Ah! Iâ€™ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
Â«Itâ€™s time to change them in a body,
The way to keep her man away! And everything became oâ€™key.
Hâ€™m, hâ€™m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk oâ€™key?
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
The novelâ€™s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
On jade postillionâ€™s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beardâ€™s shaggy.
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snowâ€™s filthy
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Allâ€™s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I donâ€™t know why.
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesnâ€™t know why)
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
K. Vyasemsky.
˜Shall we begin?â€™ â€˜Perhaps,â€™ says Lensky.
Baratynsky.
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Zhookovsky
Maidenâ€™s singing intimate, Donâ€™t peep invisibly
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
When in the gardenâ€™s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
-To Larinâ€™s -â€™Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings dailyâ€¦
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
Letâ€™s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With GÃ¶ttingen in soul frankly,
Explain to you, do it frankly.
But really?
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
It means the following thing mainly:
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Exactly...
With the berries laughingly, Donâ€™t hear secretly
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintlyâ€™.
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
˜You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!â€™
˜To me you wrote, Do not deny.
- You tell me, nanny,
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
Sheâ€™s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him Iâ€™ll occupy),
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
Heâ€™s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
And canâ€™t; sheâ€™s now deeply worrier!, She moans and sheâ€™d like to cry...
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldnâ€™t cry,
You donâ€™t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
Each shutterâ€™s open, and dry
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
Like crank by chance at feast enormous Heâ€™s angry.
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
But, seems to me Iâ€™d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
But forward, forward, you, my story!
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
To leave the world I would he sorry.
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
Well, to present you I shall tryâ€™
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isnâ€™t easy.
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
But why Talyana should be guilty?
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
For evening party...
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: Heâ€™s blessed, who knew all their pretty
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashionâ€™s duty,
˜Agreedâ€™ - You... dear guy!
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
XXXY
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
Ah, donâ€™t mindâ€™ -My friend, by God to hail I dare â€”
œUncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew heâ€™d be gladâ€.























I donâ€™t mean to please grand people.
With love friendsâ€™ notions Iâ€™d rate
And give you all that 1 could scribble
As pawn thatâ€™s worth of dear mate.
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
Of lively lucid verseâ€™s glow,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
All right, by hand unfair own
You take my set of florid rhymes
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of mind some cold observations,
Of grievous notes of the heart.
CHAPTER ONE
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
K. Vyasemsky.
I
˜My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
He made me love him with insistence And couldnâ€™t find some better test.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, itâ€™s quite distressing
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!â€™
II
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
Was shaking. Due to Zues heâ€™s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Ruslanâ€™s, Lyudmilaâ€™s friends!
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-riverâ€™s banks.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
III
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
But Eugeneâ€™s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
But then a frenchman took her place.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
Monsieur lâ€™Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
IV
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
Oneginâ€™s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
What more you want?
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
V
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
His epigramâ€™s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
VI
But Latinâ€™s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaidâ€™s.
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
VII
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldnâ€™t tell meanwhile.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
His father didnâ€™t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
YIII
To tell you all, what he had known, I havenâ€™t any time at all.
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
Moldavia, thatâ€™s far away From Italy, was end of way.
IX
X
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
For all of that
Of own life he could forget!
His look was always quick and tender,
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
XI
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw oneâ€™s gaze,
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
XII
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His nets for them were so frightening!
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
Whoâ€™s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
XIII, XIV
XV
Sometimes, when heâ€™s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
What?
Invitations for a meeting?
Three houses will wait for him.
Some balls, one childrenâ€™s entertainment...
What will he choose for his engagement?
With which to start?
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
Meanwhile heâ€™s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar heâ€™s having on	{3]
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
XVI
Its dark.
In sledge heâ€™s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
To Talonâ€™s surely heâ€™s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
XYII
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutletâ€™s fat at once,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
For theatre Oneginâ€™s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
XYIII
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
The tears of the peopleâ€™s awe. Katenin there could restore
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didlaâ€™s crowned there.
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
XIX
My goddessesâ€™ what are you? where?
You listen to my grievous call:
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Of Russian Terpsichoreâ€™s dear
Shall see emotional flight?
Or dismal eye will never find
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
With yawn Iâ€™ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
XX
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
IstÃ³minaâ€™s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
With one of feet the floor sheâ€™s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
XXI
Each claps.
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
He cast a glance at ladiesâ€™ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
Â«Itâ€™s time to change them in a body,
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressedÂ».
XXII
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
Yet outside, as wellâ€™s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
Oneginâ€™s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
XXIII
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
All fashioned model of the creature Whoâ€™s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
XXIV
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
Rousseau (Iâ€™d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasnâ€™t grasping.
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasnâ€™t right.
XXV
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
With age to argue is unfitness; The customâ€™s despot of the males.
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, Weâ€™ll call him dandy for the forth.
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
In manâ€™s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
XXVI
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
To meet the scholar worldâ€™s desire I could describe, youâ€™d be amazed.
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
XXVII
To other things letâ€™s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
XXVIII
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
Came in.
The hall is full of crowd; The musicâ€™s weary of sound;
Mazurka is the crowdâ€™s choice; All round are crush and noise;
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
XXIX
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
Itâ€™s better place for passing letters fit.
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
To you Iâ€™ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
Iâ€™d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
If not... if not, let God deliver!
I write it, as for long my time I havenâ€™t any sin of mine.
XXX
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, Iâ€™ve ruined much of own life.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
I like teenageâ€™s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But itâ€™s a stress
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
Ah! Iâ€™ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
Sad and cold,
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
XXXI
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
To touch in splendid admiration.
Is it high time as I forgot
For you the glory and the laud, The fatherâ€™s land, incarceration?
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
XXXII
Dianaâ€™s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I canâ€™t be appraising,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
XXXIII
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armidâ€™s pretty lips,
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
XXXIV
But other times in mind I bear!
I saw myself in cherished dream
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
The talkative my lyreâ€™s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
They donâ€™t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
XXXV
Whatâ€™s my Onegin?
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drumsâ€™s beat.
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
The morning pleasant noise arose.
Each shutterâ€™s open, and dry
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
XXXVI
Of balletâ€™s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
His lifeâ€™s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
XXXVII
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
XXXVIII
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
Child-Haroldâ€™s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
XXXIX, XL, XLI â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.. 	â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.. 	â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..
XLII
Of higher world the queer ladies!
The first he made - he left you all;
Itâ€™s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we canâ€™t endure,
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
XLIII
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
By him were left at your employments.
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didnâ€™t join the guild existent
Of men, whom I canâ€™t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
XLIV
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each otherâ€™s brains;
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
In all of them restrictionâ€™s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
The novelty with ages smacks.
Like women, books were all left here,
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
XLV
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
I was his friend some while ago.
I liked his features in the past:
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
I was embittered, heâ€¦ unfit.
We knew the game of passionâ€™s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
XLVI
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
He hasnâ€™t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
Great charm to any conversation.
At first his language me confused,
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
XLVI1
And often in the summerâ€™s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Do not reflect Dianaâ€™s features, Recalling bygone novelâ€™s creatures,
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
By nightâ€™s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while heâ€™s sleeping,
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
XLVIII
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Nevaâ€™s stream,
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwatâ€™s octaves tune!
XLIX
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
Appoloâ€™s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
I love him, heâ€™s my kin in-law.
Italian nights I shall adore.
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
Sometimes sheâ€™s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola Iâ€™ll travel
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarkaâ€™s language â€˜I love youâ€™ .
L
But will it come, my day of freedom?
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
Should I begin my freedom flight.
Itâ€™s time to leave for life the tight
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
LI
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
LII
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
œUncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew heâ€™d be gladâ€.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
LIII
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
Heâ€™s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
LIV
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
In country tediumâ€™s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
LV
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
For flying glory donâ€™t long.
The same I was in time of wisdom,
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
LVI
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you Iâ€™m staunch a friend.
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or itâ€™s impossible or faithless
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
LVII
All poets, meanwhile Iâ€™ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
But now, friends, from all my sides -
˜Of whom your own lyre sighs?â€™ By you Iâ€™m often briskly questioned, -
˜To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?â€™
LVIII
™Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
For thoughtful singing with attention?â€™
˜And whom your lovely verse adored?â€™
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
But road alarm of love then filled me.
All that I gladlessly survived.
Heâ€™s blessed, who with his love combined
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Arid, following Petrarkaâ€™s tracks, Could calm his heartâ€™s the biggest trouble.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
LIX
The loveâ€™s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
Iâ€™m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
I write, and heart yet isnâ€™t boring, The pen unwitting isnâ€™t drawing
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girlâ€™s small feet and no heads.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
LX
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
From novelâ€™s only beginning â€” Iâ€™ve finished now chapter one.
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
But never wanted to correct; To censorship Iâ€™ll pay my debt;
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
You get along the Nevaâ€™s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
CHAPTER TWO
O , rus!
Hor
O Russia!
I
The hamlet, where Eugeneâ€™s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
On riverâ€™s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
II
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
Allâ€™s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I donâ€™t know why.
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
III
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
IV
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
In countryâ€™s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
V
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshkyâ€™s sounds hear),
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
™Heâ€™s ignoramusâ€™, said the neighbours, â€™He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
From glass not stopping For a whileâ€™. He never kisses hands of ladies,
Says yes or no, never Ð´Ð°-Ñ Or Ð½ÐµÑ‚-Ñâ€™(the words, they all would pass).
VI
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With GÃ¶ttingen in soul frankly,
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kantâ€™s ideas and his moves.
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
VII
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
His soulâ€™s warmed with inspiration By ladyâ€™s greetings, friendly kind.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
VIII
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
IX
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goetheâ€™s, Shinerâ€™s places hiking,
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
X
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
Like thoughts of simple ladyâ€™s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
In deserts of the heavenâ€™s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
XI
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
But landlords of the countryâ€™s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relationâ€™s lint, -
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
XII
Heâ€™s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
Such customâ€™s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
XIII
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
They friends became.
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
Have less in difference between Each one.
At first theyâ€™d nothing seen In common.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
Such men (Iâ€™m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
XIV
But even such a friendship, readers, We havenâ€™t now; each of us
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
He differed people in effect, And otherâ€™s passions could respect.
XV
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
His ardent talk was full of haze;
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
And great belief in worldâ€™s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
Of young delirium high rage.
XVI
Each topicâ€™s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
XVII
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: Heâ€™s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Effects, but stepped away anew; Heâ€™s blessed much more, who never knew
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
Who fatherâ€™s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
XVIII
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
Then weâ€™ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
About otherâ€™s restless passions, And otherâ€™s love will touch the heart, -
Weâ€™ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladiesâ€™ hearts.
XIX
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
XX
Ah, he could love; they donâ€™t now Have anything like real love
Of poet, whoâ€™s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
To comfort sorrow and grief.
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
XXI
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
XXII
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
He liked the groveâ€™s timid thickness,
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret tormentâ€™s gladness...
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
XXIII
Sheâ€™s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
XXIV
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
The novelâ€™s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
Why not? Itâ€™s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
Reminiscence of old time, Of maidenâ€™s room!
We must meanwhile
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education canâ€™t adhere
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
XXV
But well, sheâ€™s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sisterâ€™s pretty grace,
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness Sheâ€™d catch oneâ€™s eyes by simple face.
Sheâ€™s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, sheâ€™s often frightened,
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
Yet being child, in childrenâ€™s throng To play and jump had none desire,
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
XXVI
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
And drifting of the countryâ€™s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
Her tender fingers didnâ€™t dare To take a needle; she could never
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
Importantly repeats for doll The motherâ€™s lessons, though small.
XXVII
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didnâ€™t play with doll;
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didnâ€™t talk at all,
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
Tatyana hadnâ€™t any trends To play with them in any weather:
Sheâ€™s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
XXVIII
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
And gradually rises day.
In winter, when the nightâ€™s weak shade
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
At usual hour stirred up, In candleâ€™s light sheâ€™s getting up.
XXIX
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughterâ€™s bed till day was dreaming
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
XXX
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
Was talking much of them with pride.
For husband then she was yet bride.
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
XXXI
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
XXXII
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasnâ€™t smoothed by any chance:
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
The way to keep her man away! And everything became oâ€™key.
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
XXXIII
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To ladyâ€™s album if by chance,
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maidenâ€™s names by names from France,
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian â€œÐ½â€ in French best manner
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
XXXIV
Her husbandâ€™s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
XXXV
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
XXXVI
And so grew they old both.
But soon for husband, all at once,
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
XXXVII
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
At neighbourâ€™s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
˜Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
And wondered: would he be alive?â€™
Sincerely, in grief embracing
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
XXXVIII
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
Alas! On furrows of lives
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
XXXIX
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
To leave the world I would he sorry.
I live and write not for applause,
But, seems to me Iâ€™d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
XL
The heart of somebody heâ€™ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
Perhaps, in Lethe wonâ€™t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Will show my renowned face And say: â€˜Itâ€™s poet of grace!â€™
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
CHAPTER THREE
Fille Ã©tait fille, elle Ã©tait amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
Malfilatre.
I
˜What way?
You poets, are queer!â€™ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
˜I donâ€™t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
-To Larinâ€™s -â€™Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings dailyâ€¦
Forgive me, isnâ€™t it too hard?â€™ -For me itâ€™s not - â€˜But dear bard,
I donâ€™t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests itâ€™s always zealous,
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horsesâ€™ stallâ€¦â€™
II
-In this I see yet no troublesâ€¦
˜But trouble is: they are such boresâ€™.
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
And thereâ€¦ -
˜For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
Iâ€™m sorry that you goâ€¦ well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
For tears, rhymes and so on?â€¦ Present me herâ€™.
- Dâ€™you joke -
˜Noâ€™.
-Iâ€™m glad. - â€˜but when?â€™ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
III
-Letâ€™s go.- They were quietly driven,
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
All services of old time.
It was well known friendly wellcome:
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
IV
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
Letâ€™s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
˜My habit,..
Iâ€¦â€™ -But you are boring
Much more... -
˜Well, no, just the same...
The field is dark in pretty gale...
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
And Iâ€™m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
V
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?â€™ -That girl, whichâ€™s always so sad;
Sheâ€™s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
˜But do you love, indeed, the other?â€™ -And what? -
˜But Iâ€™d prefer another,
If I were poet like you.
Of life her features have but few.
Like in van Dickâ€™s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, sheâ€™s boon
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizonâ€™s foolish brightnessâ€™.
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
VI
Meanwhile Oneginâ€™s stay at Larinâ€™s Was estimated like a news,
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
They joked, not without sin At Tanyaâ€™s suitor made a hint.
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
About Lenskyâ€™s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
VII
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
VIII
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
Allâ€™s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
She doesnâ€™t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
IX
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novelâ€™s beings,
Like Julieâ€™s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
X
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forestâ€™s still
With dangerous book aloneâ€™s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
But hero, Iâ€™m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
XI
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
XII
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
The vice, thatâ€™s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, whoâ€™s lost in thought,
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
XIII
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future wonâ€™t be
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself Iâ€™ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
Will take the twilight of my days.
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
XIV
In them Iâ€™ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
Of bold childrenâ€™s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
And Iâ€™ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
XV
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
With you I now tears shed;
Of tyrant you didnâ€™t fear, But now he your fate has had.
Youâ€™ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
XVI
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
In dark my Tanyaâ€™s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
XVII
˜...canâ€™t sleep, itâ€™s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...â€™
-But what is it -
˜You tell of those Your old times... Iâ€™ve boring tide..â€™
-But what about?
I had happened To know many old legends,
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
My memory is dark.., Iâ€™m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
Is drawn, in turn Iâ€™ve bad nay time.
My poor mind...
- You tell me, nanny,
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
XVIII
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Or otherwise Iâ€™d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
˜But how did you marry, nanny?â€™ -It was by wish of God.
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
My father gave consent to wed.
In fear I was crying, darling,
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
XIX
And Iâ€™m in family unknown...
But are you listening yet to me?
˜Well... I, my nannyâ€¦ donâ€™t know... For love Iâ€™m longing, dear me!
To cry, to weep Iâ€™m now ready...â€™ -I see, you are unwell already
My dear God, you bless and save!
What do you want to ask, you say!
But let me help with sacred water.
You are in heat.- - But Iâ€™m not ill Well... nanny, Iâ€™m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
XX
˜I fell in loveâ€™, again she whispers In nurseâ€™s ear in dismay.
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
˜I fell in love... youâ€™d get away
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
Tatyanaâ€™s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
XX I
While at the moon Tatyanaâ€™s looking, By own heart away sheâ€™s gone...
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
˜You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
You give a pen and paper, dear, Iâ€™ll stay in bed; make table near;
Forgive meâ€™.
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
Sheâ€™s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugeneâ€™s kept in mind,
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
The letterâ€™s ready, has been fit...
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
XXII
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
May be, you saw at Nevaâ€™s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
XXIII
Among admirers obedient Iâ€™ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
XXIV
But why Talyana should be guilty?
Because sheâ€™s innocent and plain,
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Because ire, truthfulness sheâ€™s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
But canâ€™t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
XXV
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
For love sheâ€™s dedicated truly Like loyal child for motherâ€™s nest,
She doesnâ€™t say: â€˜Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
XXVI
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
I have without any doubts Tatyanaâ€™s letter to translate.
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Thatâ€™s why in French sheâ€™s always writing.
Alas! I must repeat again:
A ladyâ€™s love until to-day To speak her Russian isnâ€™t trying,
And proud languageâ€™s now lit For prose postal a bit.
XXYII
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
Whatâ€™s the end?
Youâ€™ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
My poets! Iâ€™d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
XXVIII
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
I donâ€™t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
Perhaps Iâ€™ll grieve if in a while
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journalâ€™s call:
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
But Iâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t bother me: To old times Iâ€™ll loyal be.
XXIX
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
To have remorse I havenâ€™t forces; Like Bogdanovichâ€™s all verses Iâ€™d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
But well, its time I should be busy: The beautyâ€™s letter I should use.
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isnâ€™t easy.
I know: Parnyâ€™s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
XXX
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
With my request immodest, gladless Iâ€™d trouble you for helping me:
To make your dear magic tuning Of beautyâ€™s passion mood, resuming
Some foreign words, she often writes.
But where are you? Come! My rights
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
But in gloomy cliffs
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
Heâ€™s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
XXXI
In hands I have Tatyanaâ€™s letter. Itâ€™s kept by me with sacred sigh.
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness whoâ€™s admired?
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madmanâ€™s hearty mock.
Itâ€™s both harmful and absorbing.
All that I donâ€™t grasp.
Letâ€™s read
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
Â«FreischutzÂ» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
Tatyanaâ€™s letter to Onegin.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, Youâ€™ll never leave me such unfit.
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame Youâ€™d guess, as I would well behave
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
They say, you are a lone guy, In countryâ€™s stillness you are boring.
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
What for you visited all us?
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you Iâ€™d never know, thus I wouldnâ€™t know tortures sleepless.
Of agitated soulâ€™s feelings
With time Iâ€™d smooth and then might be Iâ€™d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
Some other...
But to no person In all the world Iâ€™d give my heart,
Itâ€™s all decided (itâ€™s my version) By heavens board: Iâ€™m yours at heart.
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
I know, you were sent by goodness, Youâ€™ll be my guard until the end,
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
And then I thought: Heâ€™s now in;
Itâ€™s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
That instant I could trunk with reason
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
You help my doubts to resolve:
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
For changes fated anyhow...
Let it be so: you have had
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
Imagine: Iâ€™m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
I stop!
I dread to read again...
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
XXXII
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letterâ€™s trembling on her palm, The waferâ€™s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
Her head to shoulderâ€™s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
But now radiant moonâ€™s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her itâ€™s all the same.
XXXIII
She doesnâ€™t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isnâ€™t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse alreadyâ€™s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, itâ€™s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
My dear early little bird!
Last evening frightful words Iâ€™d heard; Thank God!
I see you strong already!
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
XXXIV
˜Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?â€™ -All right, my dear, you command.-
˜Dâ€™you think.â€™ indeed... suspicions anyâ€¦ But do you see...
Ah, donâ€™t mindâ€™ -My friend, by God to hail I dare â€”
˜You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!â€™â€¦ -To whom, my dear?
Tell again, You see, Iâ€™m now muddle-headed.
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
XXXV
˜What slow-witted you are, nyanya!â€™ -Iâ€™m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barinâ€™s will Iâ€™d ratherâ€¦-
˜Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, Iâ€™m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Oneginâ€™ -Well done dealing.
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
But you are pale... What are you feeling? â€˜Itâ€™s nothing, nanny, not at all.
But send your boy, and first of allâ€™ .
XXXVI
The day had gone, but no answer...
Next day has come...
Sheâ€™s up at once, Like shade sheâ€™s pale, but no answer...
Well dressed, sheâ€™s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
˜And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.â€™.
Tatyanaâ€™s flushing, all sheâ€™s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
XXXVII
Itâ€™s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
By Olgaâ€™s hand the teaâ€™s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyanaâ€™s standing, Sheâ€™s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted windowâ€™s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
XXXVIII
Meanwhile her soulâ€™s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
They rush into the yard at once!
˜Ah, Eugene!â€™, - She is quickly running, Like shade sheâ€™s prompt, to exitâ€™s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back itâ€™s hard; In short a minute sheâ€™s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
XXXIX
Has fallenâ€¦
˜Hereâ€™s He! thatâ€™s Eugene!
My God! what thoughts could come to him!â€™
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Sheâ€™s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesnâ€™t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
Maidenâ€™s Song
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
Letâ€™s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
With the berries laughingly, Donâ€™t hear secretly
Maidenâ€™s singing intimate, Donâ€™t peep invisibly
At the games of maidenhood.
XL
But sheâ€™s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
But doesnâ€™t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hareâ€™s trembling
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
XLI
At last sheâ€™s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
is going, and when sheâ€™s trying To turn aside... is coming up
Just He! His gaze on her heâ€™s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her heâ€™s reaching,
And she, as if sheâ€™s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
To have a rest and have a hike, Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ll finish other time.
CHAPTER FOUR
La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier sheâ€™s liking us,
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
Of praised grandfatherâ€™s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
VIII
Who isnâ€™t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
Whom donâ€™t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendshipâ€™s heavy haze?
IX
That was the way of Eugeneâ€™s thinking.
In his first youth he was untrained,
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
By habits of the life heâ€™s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
Heâ€™s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
To protests of soulâ€™s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
X
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
For evening whist whoâ€™s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
XI
Onegin got Tatyanaâ€™s message. It quickly touched his soulâ€™s strings:
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maidenâ€™s dreams.
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
He didnâ€™t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
For garden now we shall fleet In which sheâ€™s got with him to meet.
XII
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
And. told her:
˜To me you wrote, Do not deny.
Iâ€™ve read it up:
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l donâ€™t want;
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
XIII
˜If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
If by the family best vision For instant Iâ€™d be charmed with reason,-
Believe, Iâ€™d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
Iâ€™ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
Alone you, to speak my mind, Iâ€™d take as friend of days my grievous,
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
XI
˜Iâ€™m not quite made to be much happy. My soulâ€™s alien for bliss;
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them Iâ€™m not yet worthy, miss.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used Iâ€™d run from you;
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
But they would madden it too hard.
What roses, you can be judging,
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
XV
˜In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
Whoâ€™s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
Heâ€™s always frowned, taciturn, Heâ€™s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
Thatâ€™s what I am.
Indeed, you wonâ€™t With all your pure flaming heart
Be glad with such a manâ€¦ You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Indeed, dâ€™you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
XVI
˜My dreams and years wonâ€™t rather Return to make me new a bit,
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
In early spring of every year.
You see, by skies its predestined:
Youâ€™ll fall in love once more and findâ€¦ You learn to rule yourself: I fear
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles bringsâ€™
XVII
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Through tears never seeing him,
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Did try to make of that some fun: The countryâ€™s freedom has its own
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
XVIII
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
Ah, many friends were near then!
With reason I remembered them.
XIX
And what?
Itâ€™s right.
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
In brackets I would like to note: You havenâ€™t more insulting lie,
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
With might and main heâ€™ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
XX
Hâ€™m, hâ€™m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk oâ€™key?
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
It means the following thing mainly:
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
And by the peopleâ€™s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
We them remind about us...
And let them God long live for us!
XXI
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
Itâ€™s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
Opinions of the worldly might...
And fair sex like downâ€™s slight...
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in loveâ€™s adjustment
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
XXII
But whom to love?
Whom youâ€™d be trusting?
Whoâ€™s that, which never us betrays?
Whoâ€™s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Who carefully us can cherish?
To whom my vice is not a harm?
Who never bores us by his charm?
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
Such subjectâ€™s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
XXIII
What was the sequence of the meeting?
Alas, itâ€™s easy to divine!
Of love mad sufferings sheâ€™s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
In young sad soulâ€™s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
Ali that has gone like soundâ€™s fizz, And dear Tanyaâ€™s youth all dwindles:
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
XXIV
Alas, Tatyanaâ€™s daily fading: Sheâ€™s paling, sinking and is mute,
Sheâ€™s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldnâ€™t give a hoot..
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
Itâ€™s time, its time to marry her!
But itâ€™s enough to speak of her:
Iâ€™d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanyaâ€™s dear heart indeed.
XXV
Each minute more is captivated By Olgaâ€™s beauty so young,
By bondage Lenskyâ€™s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
With her heâ€™s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
And what?
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olgaâ€™s frock.
XXVI
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Whose author bolter natureâ€™s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
But dangerous for the maidenâ€™s heart) Quite reddenning heâ€™s missing up.
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
XXVII
When heâ€™s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
In them he draws the country whole, The Kypridâ€™s temple, graves alone:
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
XXVIII
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maidenâ€™s album big,
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
As sign of friendshipâ€™s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
The first of leaflets just can show: Quâ€™ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
Itâ€™s signed by t.a.v.
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
XXIX
Without fail youâ€™ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torchâ€™s rays;
Youâ€™ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, Iâ€™d like to write,
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards theyâ€™ll not endure
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
XXX
But uncoordinated volumes From devilâ€™s library all got,
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
XXXI
Not madrigals my Lenskyâ€™s writing In Olgaâ€™s album, and indeed
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
XXXII
But hist!
Dâ€™you hear?
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
Of elegyâ€™s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
He shouts: â€˜Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!â€™
-itâ€™s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead youâ€™ll give a hope;
Is not it so, friend?
- Not, then!
You write the odes, gentlemen,
XXXIII
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..â€™
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
-What said the satirist, remember!
Is cunning liric, who can render
The â€˜elseâ€™s trendsâ€™, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
˜But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!â€™ - l could here
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages donâ€™t want.
XXXIV
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
His own works?
They say, theyâ€™d got For that the best in world reward.
Indeed, heâ€™s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
Heâ€™s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
XXXV
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
Alone to my nurse, whoâ€™s being My old friend from youth and forth.
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
Iâ€™m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
XXXVI, XXXVII
And whatâ€™s Onegin doing?
Brothers!
I ask: be patient for a time;
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
The Gulnareâ€™s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
And then he dressed himself...
XXXVIII, XXXIX
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
Oneginâ€™s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
XL
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but donâ€™t we. confess.
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
XLI
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
Youâ€™d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
He doesnâ€™t gather them with horn. A maidenâ€™s singing in her house,
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinterâ€™s crackling making light.
XLII
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
Its here: take it and be â€˜tacklingâ€™ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at riverâ€™s banks they fall.
XLIII
Such time what can you do in village?
To walk?
The seasons country views
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
But then your horse will try in fear
To scratch unfaithful icy path As heâ€™s afraid to fall at last.
Deserted room alone filling You read; itâ€™s Pradt, itâ€™s Walter Scott.
You donâ€™t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
XLIV
Like Harold Child Oneginâ€™s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
At fire-place the tableâ€™s lain: Oneginâ€™s waiting - Lenskyâ€™s speeding
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid letâ€™s have dinner before rest!
XLV
Of â€˜Clicquot widowâ€™ or â€˜Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
I â€” It sparkles by Hippocreneâ€™s role, It was by own play and foam
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
XLVI
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
It now; but â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
Whichâ€™s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
And you, â€˜Bordeauxâ€™ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
˜Bordeauxâ€™ all the times!
XLVII
The fireâ€™s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coalâ€™s crust;
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
The fire-place is fading...
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
A bowl
On tableâ€™s hissing yet, forlorn...
The evening darkness comes along...
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
But why? I donâ€™t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
XLUIII
˜But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?â€™
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
Enough, my dear...
Healthy all...
Regards of them to you Iâ€™m giving.
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
Youâ€™ll see: they all become the bosh
Letâ€™s visit them; youâ€™ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
You came two times, but then of self You donâ€™t make them yet reminding
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
XLIX
˜Me?â€™ - Yes, Tatyanaâ€™s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
˜But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
-But no one...
Pm sure... none, Theyâ€™ll be the family, the one.
Letâ€™s go, do thorn such a favour!
And what? -
˜Agreedâ€™ - You... dear guy!
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
L
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
For his delight were just awaiting.
But Hymenâ€™s troubles, griefs of mating,
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
And boring picturesâ€™ row, done In style of La Fontaineâ€™s sweet novels.
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
LI
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
A hundred times is blessed, whoâ€™s faithful. Whoâ€™s got his wit to be quite calm,
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
But wretched is, whoâ€™s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
CHAPTER FIVE
Oh, donâ€™t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
Zhookovsky
I
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
By winter carpets, snow-made.
Allâ€™s blight, allâ€™s white without shade.
II
Itâ€™s winter!..
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
A brave sledge-cart from fieldâ€™s returning, Itâ€™s fluffy furrows upturning,
The coachmanâ€™s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
A yard boyâ€™s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
While he prefered to play a steed. His fingerâ€™s frozen a little,
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his motherâ€™s finger shakes.
III
But may be those kinds of pictures By now canâ€™t you all attract,
As they are mean and simple features, You wonâ€™t see fine art in that.
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winterâ€™s bliss and tinges all:
Heâ€™ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
IV
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesnâ€™t know why)
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
The snowâ€™s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
V
Tatyana trusted legendâ€™s fancies Of simple folkâ€™s old times.
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
By many signs sheâ€™s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
If sheâ€™s seeing
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
VI
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
And when a falling shining star
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isnâ€™t fading,
The wish of heart to whisper her.
And when sometimes in front of her
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
VII
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
To guess the windy youth is trying
Which doesnâ€™t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
VIII
Tatyanaâ€™s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mindâ€™s the secret backs.
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
- All they are yet feeling
Some loss in all the songâ€™s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
IX
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heavenâ€™s bodies light
All flows in a single gear...
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirrorâ€™s aiming down,
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
The snowâ€™s crackling... someoneâ€™s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
What is your name? - Heâ€™s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphonâ€¦
X
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
Was too afraid, I must confess...
But with Tatyana shanâ€™t we guess.
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
Her maidenâ€™s mirror yet she keeps.
It all is still.
Tatyana steeps.
XI
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Across a glade, all under snow Around which allâ€™s dark and sad.
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isnâ€™t frozen by frost.
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, sheâ€™s standing still.
XII
As at the reason of the parting Tatyanaâ€™s grumbling at the brook,
She doesnâ€™t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
The snow-drift at once is moving...
And who, dâ€™you think, from it is looking?
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: â€˜Ah!â€™ But he becomes
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw heâ€™s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful sheâ€™s shyly stepping
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runsâ€¦ the bearâ€™s after her!
XIII
Of looking back she doesnâ€™t dare And hurries up, sheâ€™s quickening steps,
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
The heavenâ€™s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
XIV
She runs for forest... heâ€™s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
To take it up she canâ€™t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
Sheâ€™s running - he is after her; She canâ€™t be running any more,
XV
She falls on snow - he is swifty: Heâ€™s taking her in paws and brings,
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesnâ€™t move and doesnâ€™t breathe;
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
Itâ€™s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss theyâ€™ve had;
˜There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!â€™
To inner porch he goes fast, Heâ€™s laying down her at last.
X U1
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
Oneâ€™s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
With goatâ€™s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
A dwarf with tail; and thereâ€™s that Whoâ€™s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
XVII
But thatâ€™s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
At gooseâ€™s neck a skull is fateful, Itâ€™s whirling round for all sides;
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Oneginâ€™s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
XVIII
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
That heâ€™s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pullâ€¦
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Oneginâ€™s eyes make tire own,
Heâ€™s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
XIX
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
And canâ€™t; sheâ€™s now deeply worrier!, She moans and sheâ€™d like to cry...
But canâ€™t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hadesâ€™ spectres
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: â€˜Itâ€™s mine! Its mineâ€™
XX
˜Itâ€™s mine!â€™ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanyaâ€™s shoulder he bends;
But suddenly her sisterâ€™s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she canâ€™t have breath..
XXI
They argue louder; heâ€™s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
Heâ€™s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
In horror Tanya is awaking...
She sees: the room is light again, Through windowâ€™s a frosty pane
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Like North Auroraâ€™s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
˜But now tell;â€™ she says, â€˜to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?â€™
XXII
At sister Tanya isnâ€™t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
This kind of book yet doesnâ€™t show The writerâ€™s fancies in a row,
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Ladyâ€™s Fashion Journal had
Less influence on ladyâ€™s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
The head of Chaldean wise men, â€” Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
XXIII
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
Malvinaâ€™s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
Marmontelâ€™s volume them he gave.
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
XXIV
That dream aroused her misgivings.
Not grasping ways to understand
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
In bookâ€™s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
Etcetera.
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
XXV
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
An Laneâ€™s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
XXVI
With own wife thatâ€™s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children youâ€™d be seeing
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy PetushkÃ³v,
With him my cousin first BuyÃ¡nov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired FlyÃ¡nov,
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
XXVII
With KharlikÃ³v PanfÃ­l and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
Who left TambÃ³v without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poetâ€™s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Was brave instead of â€˜elle Ninaâ€™ To put the â€˜belle Tatianaâ€™
XXVIII
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
He came, What news, such sentimental!
Well have the music regimental!
The colonel sent it for the chance.
What joy: to-day weâ€™ll have to dance!
The girls are jumping all around.
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
To come to tables hand in hand.
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
XXIX
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
They donâ€™t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
˜Ah, my Lord!â€™,
The mistress cries, â€˜At last youâ€™ve got!â€™
In crowd everybody renders:
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
XXX
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Sheâ€™s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
Sheâ€™s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
XXXI
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
Like crank by chance at feast enormous Heâ€™s angry.
And Tatyanaâ€™s nervous
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, heâ€™s being in a whim.
Heâ€™s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lenskyâ€™s head For sufferings, he here had.
Already for triumph heâ€™s waiting,
And he invents by whimâ€™s requests Caricatures of the guests.
XXXII
Of course, Oneginâ€™s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
Zhizhi, my soulâ€™s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
XXXIII
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence nowâ€™s keeping.
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And she has had
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
XXXIV
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, heâ€™s admired;
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
Such charming, tender.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tamaâ€™s heart.
XXXV
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
XXXVI
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
They all replaced for each of roberts; The teaâ€™s been brought.
I could define
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
Every country eater
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
In brackets to the point Iâ€™d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX
The teaâ€™s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga PetushkÃ³v then whirls,
With Tanya Lensky; KharlikÃ³va, The bride of more than ripening age,
By hard from big TambÃ³vâ€™s engaged; BuyhÃ¡nov whirls with PustyakÃ³va,
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
XL
At the beginning of my novel â€” (In chapter first you look it all)
Iâ€™d like to use the Albanâ€™s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
Of known ladies feet and legs.
But by your narrow small tracks,
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
The further Iâ€™m from youth my gay,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
And even this my chapter five â€” From all digressions to refine.
XLI
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Then he for her a chairâ€™s finding, They speak about this and that,
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again heâ€™s dancing.
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
XLII
Mazurkaâ€™s sounding.
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquetâ€™s cracks wee heard again.
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
XLIII, XLIV
BuyÃ¡nov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
Lensky saw
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
XLV
But yet she canâ€™t.
And whatâ€™s the reason?
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
Onegin.
Goodness me, it isnâ€™t For him to hear!
What a whim...
Impossible!?
Sheâ€™s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
And. so cunny, she is gay. Alreadyâ€™s able to betray!
He canâ€™t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
Two pistols in a row,
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
CHAPTER SIX
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui iâ€™morir non dole.
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
I
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
And Olgaâ€™s yawning; round here Sheâ€™s looking for her Lensky dear.
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
At last it stopped.
All have the supper.
The beds are made. And any guest
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maidenâ€™s.
All they utter
A need for sleep.
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
II
Allâ€™s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy PustyakÃ³v
With own heavy hall, his dear; GvozdÃ­n, BuyÃ¡nov, PetushkÃ³v
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
In Tanyaâ€™s, Olgaâ€™s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
At window alone, sad (Dianaâ€™s ray lights up, her wakens)
My poor Tanya sits, canâ€™t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
III
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By got by Olga strange tuition Sheâ€™s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
Sheâ€™s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
Sheâ€™s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foeâ€™s hand
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
˜Iâ€™ll perish, - says my Tanyaâ€™s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
I donâ€™t grudge: why should I grudge?
He canâ€™t give happiness at largeâ€™.
IV
But forward, forward, you, my story!
My muse new person just reveals.
Some several miles from KrasnogÃ³ry, From Lenskyâ€™s village, there lives
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
ZarÃ©tsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. â€” Hut now simply good the head
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
V
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
At Verreyâ€™s every morningâ€™s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
VI
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
VII
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
˜Sed alia temporalâ€™ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
VIII
Heâ€™s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; thatâ€™s why at borne
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
But after first cordial greeting Zaretskyâ€™s silent for a while
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
IX
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didnâ€™t want:
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
Alone with his soulâ€™s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
X
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasnâ€™t right at all
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
It is forgivable.
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
XI
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
But at least
Itâ€™s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Is spoiled by old duels fan, Heâ€™s evil, gossip, talking man...
Of course, he thinks, â€˜I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..â€™
Opinion of the public mournful!
The spring of honour, idol last!
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
XII
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
And now jealouserâ€™s triumphant!
He was afraid of being answered
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
Of enemy from pistol parried.
But now doubts all are solved:
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
XIII
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didnâ€™t want
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun heâ€™s looking on...
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
His Olgaâ€™s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
Sheâ€™s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
XIV
˜What for you early disappeared?â€™
Was asking Olya him at once
My Lenskyâ€™s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
He looks al her with tender ardour; Heâ€™s yet beloved with previous force,
Heâ€™s now languished by remorse, Heâ€™s being ready to beg pardon,
Heâ€™s trembling, loses fitting words, Heâ€™s happy, has improved his health,
XV, XVI, XVII
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
He thinks of here:
˜Iâ€™ll be defender; Iâ€™ll not endure when offender
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lilyâ€™s stem
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintlyâ€™.
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine Iâ€™ve shooting things.
XVIII
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyanaâ€™s heart was burnt!
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
On earth, then might be by her love Sheâ€™d joined the friends the day above!
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
XIX
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: â€˜Iâ€™ve my happy days...â€™
But it is late, itâ€™s time to go...
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
At him she stares all the way:
˜Whatâ€™s happened?â€™- `Nothingâ€™â€¦ - Gets away.
XX
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shillerâ€™s work.
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesnâ€™t slumber,
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
XXI
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
˜Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
What does next day for me prepare?
In vain I try to be aware,
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
Allâ€™s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
XXII
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
Some tears shed at urn my early: â€˜He tell in love with me,â€™ to thinks
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!â€™
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, Iâ€™m husband yours by love!"
XXIII
His verse is sluggish and obscure (Itâ€™s called romanticism by us;
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on tableâ€™s falling
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
˜Itâ€™s seven soon, itâ€™s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to waitâ€™.
He was mistaken: sleeping fair â€” Onegin then for world was dead,
The shades of night are now rare And Vesperâ€™s met by cock ahead.
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
From bed Onegin wasnâ€™t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtainâ€™s moving
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
XXV
He hurries up to ring.
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
Oneginâ€™s quick to dress. Already His sernantâ€™s ordered to be ready
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it heâ€™s flying to the mill;
Has come; to servant says he will Lepageâ€™s fatal barrels steady
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
XXVI
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
Oneginâ€™s coining with excuses.
Zaretsky to behave refuses: â€˜But where is the second yours?â€™
In duels classic, pedant cross
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
He didnâ€™t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
As legends say of old age (For that weâ€™d praise in him the sage).
XXVII
™My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
I canâ€™t foresee any objection To this representation made.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!â€™
Zaretskyâ€™s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
˜Shall we begin?â€™ â€˜Perhaps,â€™ says Lensky.
And quickly both they yet off
Behind the mill.
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Grand treatyâ€™s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
XXVIII
The foes!
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Of daily troubles.
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
Prepare ruins once for ever...
Theyâ€™d better laugh before they had
With blood sustained each pure hand... Theyâ€™d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
The enmityâ€™s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
XXIX
The pistols all are now shining, The hammerâ€™s jingling at the lock,
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistolâ€™s cock.
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
And stands at stint
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
The foes put the capes on steppe.
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
XXX
˜You now meet...â€™ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
Four fatal for the life the stages...
His pistol then Onegin raises
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
The clockâ€™s been striking
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
XXXI
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
His misty, foggy gaze
Expresses death but not the torture.
From mountains descends this way
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
He looks, he calls him - allâ€™s for nothing!
He isnâ€™t moreâ€¦ The youngling bard
Has found end untimely hard!
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altarâ€™s gone.
XXXII
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy browâ€™s languid peace.
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
But like a house all deserted Itâ€™s dark and still, and not by chance
Itâ€™s mute for ever all at once.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
The masterâ€™s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
XXXIII
Itâ€™s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
Itâ€™s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
Unwittingly in mirrorâ€™s peeping Ashamed to recognize: heâ€™s beaten;
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
And much the more itâ€™s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures wonâ€™t be the best.
XXXIV
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
XXXY
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
˜Well, he is killedâ€™,- the neighbour said.
Heâ€™s killed!..
By dreadful exclamation Oneginâ€™s shuddered; slain, impatient
To call some people gets away.
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, Heâ€™s taking home dreadful hoard,
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
XXXVI
My friends, on bard youâ€™d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadnâ€™t time
But withered!
Whereâ€™s agitation And honourable aspiration
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
XXXVII
He, might be, for the worldâ€™s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
For centures to make him known.
On steps of world the bard might go
Upstairs to the highest rate.
But his such sufferable shade,
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
Heâ€™ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
XXXVIII, XXX1X
It might he other: heâ€™d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
The youthful years would be fading, The soulâ€™s heat would not be hot
In many trends heâ€™d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
XL
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young loverâ€™s lot:
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
XLI
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
A shepherd bast gay sandalâ€™s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
At brook the monument is seeing Sheâ€™s drawing made of leather rein,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
XLII
And slowly through fields sheâ€™s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soulâ€™s filled
She thinks:
˜Whith Olga what could happen?
Or not for long her heart was shattered
And passed away of tears time?
And where is her sister line?
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?â€™
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
XLIII
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
Of course, of him Iâ€™ll quickly know,- For him I now havenâ€™t time.
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soulâ€™s quiet dream.
XLIV
Iâ€™ve heard some voice of new desire, Iâ€™ve got new sorrow anew;
By new one canâ€™t I be admired I pity old one - itâ€™s true.
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
And is it true, it canâ€™t return?
And am I soon at thirties turn?
XLV
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
Oâ€™key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
Iâ€™m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
To you Iâ€™m greatful!
You alone Among anxieties in still
Could me enjoy... Iâ€™ve had my fill; It is enough!
With clear soul
New way Iâ€™m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
XLVI
Let me look back.
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soulâ€™s haze.
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
You donâ€™t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
CHAPTER SEVEN
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
Dmitriyev.
How would you not love Moscow?
Baratynsky.
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
Where is it better?
Where we have never been.
Griboyedov
I
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
By clear smile the natureâ€™s fitting Through dream the yearâ€™s morning meeting
The shining skies are now blued.
Yet limpid is the near wood
As if by greenish down covered.
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
Is flying from the waxy cell.
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
II
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the countryâ€™s still!
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
III
Or arenâ€™t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forestâ€™s thicks?
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
The withering of own days, Which canâ€™t revive by any ways?
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
IV
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
V
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winterâ€™s mirth youâ€™d had.
With dear muse of mine capricious Letâ€™s hear forestâ€™s noise delicious
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
VI
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for riverâ€™s crook.
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
˜Vladimir Lensky hereâ€™s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
At such a year, such an age.
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!â€™
VII
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
But now...
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
Decayed...
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
The shepherdâ€™s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
VIII, IX, X
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldnâ€™t be.
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
That uhlanâ€™s loved by all her soulâ€¦ At altar now does she stand
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
XI
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
All yet living
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
XII
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larinâ€™s soon forever went:
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldnâ€™t cry,
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
XIII
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
XIV
And in the solitude severe Her passionâ€™s heating yet much more,
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
But heâ€™s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
What for to grieve?
XV
The evening skyâ€™s more dark.
The waters Are still.
Some noise by beetleâ€™s raised.
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
The fisherâ€™s fire.
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
In own dreams allâ€™s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
She looks, and all her own heart More oftenâ€™s heating and more hard.
XVI
The doubts all confused her soul:
˜Shall go forth or should return?..
He isnâ€™t here...
Iâ€™m unknown...
Iâ€™ll take a look and then turnâ€™,
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
Bewildered and astonished hard...
She enters a deserted yard.
All barking, dogs to her are running.
At her much frightened loud cries
Of yard boys family just flies.
Ran up and not without fighting
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
XYII
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
As quick as can
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novelâ€™s crank.
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
And with a bow
The woman says:
˜At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
XVIII
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
You now come to rooms, the inner...
And here is the banns room.
He slept and coffee had he here, His menagerâ€™s reports could hear,
A book at mornings here read...
And old barin room this had;
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
To play the cards was used with me.
Let give the God his soul chances
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!â€™
XIX
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soulâ€™s rate
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
XX
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
Itâ€™s late.
Some cold wind just blows.
Itâ€™s dark in valleys.
Rather well The grove sleeps.
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet sheâ€™s sighing once again
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
XXI
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
And in a day
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
For long is weeping she this time.
But then with books she could be dealing.
At first of them she didnâ€™t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
XXII
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
XXIII
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
Tatyanaâ€™s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
At margins of the books sheâ€™s meeting Of readerâ€™s pencil slightest signs:
Oneginâ€™s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
XXIV
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
Thank God, more clearly - sheâ€™s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Whatâ€™s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
Of stylish words some ready set?
Is he a parody not yet?
XXV
Is really the secretâ€™s found?
Or really she guessed not wrong?
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
˜You see, Tatyanaâ€™s not a child,â€™ The old womanâ€™s voice is mild,-
˜Of them my Olga is the younger.
To fix her fate itâ€™s time, I see;
What shall I do, I canâ€™t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
˜Do not.â€™
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
XXVI
™But may be sheâ€™s in love?â€™ â€˜Who knows?
BuyÃ¡nov courted: was refused.
To PetushkÃ³v she never goes; PykhtÃ­n, the hussar, toed to fuse
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what dâ€™you think? again collapse!â€™
˜Well, dear me, what is the matter?
For fair of the brides her bring,
To Moscow, they need good things.â€™..,
˜Ah, father my! the profitâ€™s worsened..â€™.
˜For single winter it will do, At least Iâ€™ll credit money youâ€™â€¦
XXVII
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
She courtedâ€¦ at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
To judgings by the world severe
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
XXVIII
Sheâ€™s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
˜Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
And you forgive, my freedom later!
For what and where do I strive?
And what can give me fate of mine?â€™
XXIX
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
She hurries up to have a chat.
But summerâ€™s flying quicker yet.
The autumn golden is coming, The natureâ€™s now trembling, pale
Like victim under charming veil.
And now North, all clouds driving,
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
XXX
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
But Tanyaâ€™s heart yet isnâ€™t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
Canâ€™t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
XXXI
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
XXXII
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfastâ€™s ready in the room.
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
On jade postillionâ€™s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beardâ€™s shaggy.
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
Boom could fade.
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
˜Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
But shall I see you?â€™ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
XXXIII
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
At any sides weâ€™ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
XXXIV
We havenâ€™t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
The inns are absent.
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
A menu hangs for orderâ€™s sake And teases appetite in vain.
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forgeâ€™s light
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
XXXV
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winterâ€™s even every way.
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
XXXVI
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
My Moscow... in this lunation
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
XXXVII
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
It in strain
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didnâ€™t come at all to him
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
XXXVIII
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Go on!
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
XXXIX, XL
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
At KharitÃ³nyaâ€™s in the alley In front of house at the gate
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
XLI
- Princess, mon ange! -
˜Pachette!â€™- Alina!
˜Who might be thinking... all the time!
For how long?
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
My God, a scene from novels dear...â€™ -And thatâ€™s my daughter...
Tanya, near!
˜Ah, Tanya!
Dear! come to rueâ€¦ As in a dream it seems to be...
Dâ€™you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?â€™
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
Well, I remember... has he gone?
At Simeonâ€™s heâ€™s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
XLII
And that... but afterwards youâ€™ll know, Is not it true?
With kin to meet
To-morrow weâ€™ll Tanya show...
But I can hardly drag my feet,
To be with you I cannot go...
But you are tortured by the road.
Letâ€™s come together... take a rest...
I havenâ€™t force... is tired breastâ€¦
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For nowhere am I smart...
With age the life is such a badness...â€™
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
XLIII
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
Nor makes get up without choosing.
At window she now sits.
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields sheâ€™s now looking:
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
XLIV
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
And exclamations at the board:
˜What big is Tanya!
Is it not
That recently I was you christening?â€™
I was taking you in hands!
˜And I your ears pulled by hands!â€™
˜And I was gingebread you giving!â€™
And all grandparents exclaim: â€™But how years fly away!â€™
XLV
In them you canâ€™t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
Is whitening on LukÃ©rya Lvovna, The same yet lies LytibÃ³v PetrÃ³vna.
IvÃ¡n PetrÃ³vichâ€™s fool and bore, SemyÃ³n PetrÃ³vich stints yet more;
With PelagÃ©ya NikolÃ¡vna The sameâ€™s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
The same is dog, the sameâ€™s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
XLVI
My Tanyaâ€™s hugged by their daughters.
Of Moscow young graces good
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet sheâ€™s looking rather slim;
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maidenâ€™s choice,
XLVII
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
In tender manner they agree.
But Tanya now like in dream
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
XLVIII
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
In talks allâ€™s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
XLIX
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
At boring auntâ€™s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
L
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
While sheâ€™s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
Or where Thaliaâ€™s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isnâ€™t listening;
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
LI
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once oneâ€™s feelings strikes.
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
And unattentive smart lornette.
On leave the gussars hasten here
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
LII
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heavenâ€™s blue
Among the friends the moonâ€™s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
But She whom I yet donâ€™t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
With heavenly her pride sheâ€™s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
Of what a languorâ€™s full her breast?
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
LIII
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
Meanwhile
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this worldâ€™s fuss sheâ€™s hatred feeling.
Sheâ€™s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
LIV
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Meanwhile his eyes off her canâ€™t tear Some general important, grand.
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
And whispered her each one of them: â€˜You look left side at those menâ€¦â€™
˜Left side?.. but where? what is there?â€™ I â€˜It doesnâ€™t matter, but you look,
Dâ€™you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
He stepped away... he turned a bit..â€™-
˜But who? plump general that big?â€™
LV
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
Letâ€™s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend Iâ€™m now singing,
Of multiplied his own crank.
You now bless long yearsâ€™ work
My muse in ethics well embodied!
To me true compass now lend
Haphazard wander to prevent.
Enough... and has been done the burden:
Well, I saluted classicism! Itâ€™s late, but preface has been seen.
CHAPTER EIGHT
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Byron
I
That time, when in lyceumâ€™s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didnâ€™t read,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
My studentâ€™s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
II
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
III
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
IV
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
Sheâ€™s after me.
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
By sorcery of storyâ€™s secrets!
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
And often at Tauridaâ€™s beaches She brought me in the have of night
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
V
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
But suddenly was changed it all:
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
VI
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
VII
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
What for yet here has he been?
Whoâ€™s he?
Not Eugene heâ€™s at most?
But really?
Yes, It is he...
For long has chance with us to be?
VIII
Is he the same or quiet now?
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
What kindâ€™s he now anyhow?
And what for is can now lurid?
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least heâ€™d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole worldâ€¦
Dâ€™you know?...
- Yes and no yet.
IX
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
The follyâ€™s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
X
Heâ€™s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! Heâ€™s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
XI
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
Have been decayed in natureâ€™s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
XII
As object of the judging noisy, In life youâ€™d never have a wish:
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him Iâ€™ll occupy),
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
XIII
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
XIV
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
To hostess a ladyâ€™s heading, Some plump grand generalâ€™s behind.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
She doesnâ€™t glare at the rest, And doesnâ€™t claim to have success;
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricksâ€¦
Sheâ€™s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Do comme il fautâ€¦ (Shishkov, forgive; canâ€™t some good translation give).
XV
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
They didnâ€™t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashionâ€™s duty,
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I canâ€™t...
XVI
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
In life with us like new itâ€™s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But letâ€™s return to lady sitting.
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
XVII
˜Indeed? - my Eugeneâ€™s now thinking, - But is it true?..
Exactly...
Not...
Why! out of the country thickets...â€™
Lornette his captious he has got,
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
Forgotten features can remind.
˜You tell me, prince, if donâ€™t mind,
Whoâ€™s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?â€™,
The prince as if anew him sees:
˜I see, in world youâ€™ve been too rare...
Well, to present you I shall tryâ€™
˜But who is she?â€™ She is my wife,
XVIII
˜What, you are married! didnâ€™t know!
And how long?â€™ â€˜Two will he fast...â€™
˜And whom?â€™ - Sheâ€™s Larinâ€™s. -
˜Tanya though!â€™ â€˜Dâ€™you know her?-
˜Iâ€™m neighbour justâ€™.
˜Well, let us goâ€¦â€™ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
Presents his friend and distant kin.
Princess is staring at him...
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
XIX
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
And no brow moved she rasher; She didnâ€™t even lips her press.
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
Could my Onegin now find.
To have a talk with her he tried
Andâ€¦ he could not.
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
If their district visits on?
And then at prince she was adjusting
Her tired look and slipped away...
Unmoving, lone heâ€™s again.
XX
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
And where everythingâ€™s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
XXI
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
For evening party...
˜Lord! to her!..
Yes, I shall come, Iâ€™ll come!â€™ - before
His lunch him answered with politeness.
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
XXII
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
Itâ€™s striking ten; heâ€™s driving out. Heâ€™s flying... now heâ€™s at porch.
He trembles... to princess heâ€™s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
Together for a time they sit.
Are silent.
Not a word can slip
Away from Eugeneâ€™s lips; morose, Heâ€™s awkward, hardly has he force
To answer her.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, sheâ€™s free.
XXIII
Her husband comes.
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
And with Oneginâ€™s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
And didnâ€™t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
XXIV
The capitalâ€™s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
XXV
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
With Lea, thatâ€™s given him too sweety; With ladiesâ€™ flatness; tunes of men;
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
With war; with magazineâ€™s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: Whatâ€™s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have youâ€™d like, Or Eden to itselfâ€™s unlike.
XXVIII
But how greatly Tanyaâ€™s altered!
Her role how firmly played,
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
Of legislator of the halls?
And he inspired her at dawns!
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
XXIX
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
XXX
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
In languish of the loving bounds Heâ€™s spending now day and night.
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
Heâ€™s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
XXXI
To him she doesnâ€™t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isnâ€™t seeing;
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
To loose his colour heâ€™s beginning: She doesnâ€™t see or sheâ€™s too hard!?
Oneginâ€™s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
XXXII
He doesnâ€™t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
Before arrival; anyhow She isnâ€™t bothered (thatâ€™s female!);
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
A passionate epistleâ€™s writing.
In letters though he again
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
Became alredy quite inapt.
His letterâ€™s here, quite exact.
Eugeneâ€™s letter to Tatyana
I can foresee: youâ€™ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
But what Iâ€™d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
I didnâ€™t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
As I to loose my freedom feared Whichâ€™s hateful to my own will.
But something more us separated...
Unlucky victim, Lenskyâ€™s gone...
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
By nothing bound, Iâ€™m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
Replace the fortune.
Goodness me!
What blunder! Iâ€™m a punished ranger.
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
Iâ€™ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you Iâ€™m dangling:
I prize my hours, my days: But Iâ€™m in idle boredom wasting
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
I dread: in my submissive prayers Youâ€™ll see by strict, severe gaze
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
If you could know, whatâ€™s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
I canâ€™t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
XXXIII
But no answer...
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
Without answer.
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
To meet princess.
But what severe!
Heâ€™s not been seen, none word from dear;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
Oneginâ€™s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Of tears tracks?..
But none she had!
Her face but has of wrath a track...
XXXIV
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (Thatâ€™s all he knew in own world...)
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
XXXV
Again promiscuosly heâ€™s readingâ€¦ Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
XXXVI
And what?
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
At other kinds of lines.
To them He paid his all attention then.
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
XXXVII
And by degrees to sleep heâ€™s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
In front of him gay fancyâ€™s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: â€˜Well, heâ€™s killed...â€™
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
XXXIII
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
Indeed, by magnetismâ€™s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student heâ€™s a dunce.
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
XXXIX
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
He couldnâ€™t be a bard for ever, He didnâ€™t go mad or die,
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snowâ€™s filthy
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
But where now through them speeds
XL
My dashing Eugene?
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
None soulâ€™s seen in rooms at entrance...
For her heâ€™s looking on... for nought...
He opened a door."
And what.
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
Princess, undone yet before him
Aloneâ€™s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
XLI
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
Sheâ€™s not astonished, hasnâ€™t anger...
His morbid and quite dying look,
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
A simple maiden
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
XLII
To get him up she isnâ€™t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
About what sheâ€™s now dreaming?
Too long the silenceâ€™s now seeming...
And stilly does she say at last:
˜Enough, get up, I now must
Explain to you, do it frankly.
You must remember that day time,
When in the gardenâ€™s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
XLIII
˜Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
Of humble girl some secret love?
But now - God! - is cooling blood
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
But I
Canâ€™t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
To me that time you were quite right,â€™ To you is grateful soul mine...
XLIV
˜But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
You didnâ€™t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
And me you have in view...
What purpose?
Is it because in higher circles
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
In actions husbandâ€™s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
Or thatâ€™s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
XLV
˜I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
That time to all my childish dreams
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
XLVI
˜To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
Whatâ€™s use?
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
XLVII
˜And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
But my fate
Decided is.
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
Some real honour and the pride.
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
Theyâ€™ve made me marry other man; And Iâ€™ll be true to him till end!
XLVIII
She went away.
My Eugeneâ€™s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyanaâ€™s husband just appears,
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
Alter him
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
My greetings!
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
Indeed, for long should have the end!
XLIX
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, Iâ€™d like with you
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
Forgive!
What for would ever view
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journalâ€™s clamour
A mere hit from all Iâ€™d give.
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
L
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
But many days away could get
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
LI
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Without them Onegmâ€™s pictured.
And she, that young and lovely creature;
Ideal image, Tanyaâ€™s rhyme...
Ah, many were by fate denied!
Heâ€™s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end lifeâ€™s novel reading,
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
THE END
